// The observed page graph: which screen has actually been seen to follow which.
//
// Not a hand-authored sitemap. One of those was turned down for three reasons,
// the third being that it could not be validated -- 35 pages of hand-written
// successor sets with no regression gate, where a missing edge is a permanent
// `Unknown`. This is the answer to that: a ledger of transitions the script was
// measured making, which accumulates across pulls and can be checked rather
// than believed. The harvesting tools live outside this repo and write through
// this module; PAGE_DISPATCH.md's sitemap is rendered from it here.
//
// ## Where the data comes from
//
// `PageRouter.saveHistoryShot` (src/pages.ts) writes one matcher-space frame per
// page change to `<device folder>/history/<seq>_<PageName>.png`. The
// *filenames* are the record: ordered, page-labelled visits. So a harvest is one
// `adb shell ls` and no image transfer at all.
//
// Three properties of that directory shape everything here:
//
//   * It is a sliding window, not a session. A frame is deleted as its visit
//     falls off `historyDepth` (default 20), so one pull sees the tail of the
//     last run and nothing before it. The ledger accumulates; a single pull
//     never will.
//   * Sequence numbers restart with the run and the directory is wiped at
//     startup, so seq is unique *within* a run and repeats across runs. That is
//     why dedup below is best-effort and `count` is a confidence signal rather
//     than a statistic.
//   * A gap in the sequence is a visit whose frame failed to save, not a
//     transition. `pairsFrom` requires consecutive numbers before it will call
//     two visits an edge.
//
// It also needs "Debug game" on, because that is what sets `keepShots`.
//
// ## The other source
//
// `taskWalkthrough` (src/walkthrough.ts) records a whole hand-driven walk --
// every screen, every tap on it, and what followed -- into one session file. It
// needs a person, but it is not a window and it carries the taps, so an edge
// harvested from one says *where you press to take it*. `mergeSession` folds
// those in beside the pageHistory pairs.
