# Changelog

All notable changes to the Tsum Tsum script. Format based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

**One section per version, named for `package.json`'s `version`.** There is no
`[Unreleased]`: an entry goes under whatever version the package is on, and
bumping the version is what opens the next section. Cutting a release does not
close one -- `npm run release:*` publishes the section for the version it built,
and later work on that same version reopens and republishes it.

**`### Summary` opens every section, and it is the user-facing changelog.**
`npm run release:*` reads those bullets and nothing else to fill the `Message`
field of the catalogue entry -- the release note a player reads on a phone, in a
card a few lines tall. A bullet is:

- **one line**: a sentence, no sub-bullets, no wrapped paragraph;
- **one bullet per feature, not per change** -- a new skill is "Coronation Day
  Elsa skill added", and a later round of work on it is "Coronation Day Elsa
  skill improved by making clears faster". Every pass over the same feature
  folds into that one line; *how* it was done belongs in the sections below;
- about **what a player sees or does** -- a setting, a screen, a stats column,
  behaviour they would notice. If it can only be said in file, key or API names,
  it is not one;
- **never internals**: refactors, tooling, docs, detection plumbing, tests, and
  build or release machinery all stay below.

Keep the list short enough to read on that card; over `MessageMaxChars`
(`config.json`) the release refuses rather than shipping one that scrolls.

The sections under it are the internal record, for whoever works on this next:
everything that changed, user-facing or not, **one or two lines each** -- what
changed, and the one fact that explains why. Measurements, rejected designs and
long reasoning belong in the design docs (`OBSCURED_BOARD.md`, `LOGGING.md`,
`DRIVING_SCREENS.md`, `PAGE_DISPATCH.md`, `DEVELOPMENT.md`).

**Two things are filed elsewhere.** Versions before 1.0 are in
`CHANGELOG_0.x.md`. Coronation Day Elsa's entries go in `CHANGELOG_ELSA.md`
while she stays off the production build, so her work does not reach the
release note; they fold back in here when she ships.

## [5.0a2]

### Summary

- Now requires General Automation Platform 3.1 or newer.
- Each device keeps its own folder, so emulator instances sharing one storage folder no longer overwrite each other's stats, reports and screenshots. Files now live under `devices/<name>_<id>/` with shorter names: `stats/`, `reports/`, `history/`, `corpus/`, `walkthrough/`, `tmp/`. Older files stay where they were and are no longer read, though Tsum Tsum Stats still imports them.
- Stop after games setting added (General, and the Quick Bar's second page): after a set number of rounds, turn off Auto Play, pause or stop the script.
- Quick Bar "Last round" button added: stops the script once the current round is over.
- Quick Bar Auto Play toggle (a play-on-repeat icon) replaces the Report button: turn round-playing on or off without restarting the script. Preset and Bubble get more room, as the readout is narrower too. Reports are still on the settings page's Debug tab and the Log button's long press.
- Disney Villains (Set) now plays properly, records score and coins in the stats file, and works with Auto Unlock MyTsum Level. Its own skill setting (Alpha) keeps it chaining when its skill turns the tsums into big neon villains.
- Nightmare Before Christmas (Set) skill improved by rerolling Oogie Boogie's dice only on a roll under 7, and by tracking the shrinking tsums more steadily.
- Gaston and Coronation Day Elsa skills and the Delay Skill ReActivation setting are out of Beta.
- Chains no longer break in a round's last seconds.
- Round stats no longer lose the score and coins when the rank-up panel appears after a round, and base coins read more reliably.
- Auto Play Game setting moved from General to the Round tab.
- Tsum app restart frequency now counts in minutes (30-minute steps) and sits under Device, out of Experimental.
- Large tsums are now recognised and used in chains, linking from farther away as the game allows; they used to be skipped or mistaken for a small tsum.
- Tsum List export now records which Tsums are favourites, and it and Unlock Level jump straight to the first page of the Tsum collection instead of paging back one at a time.
- Bubbles get popped faster: more are spotted at the bottom of the board, All Bubbles ASAP pops them on sight, the Mid Chain strategies no longer let them pile up, and new Save One and Save One Mid Chain strategies pop all but one (on sight, or as a chain lands).
- Settings page and Quick Bar redesigned in the GAP look: clearer cards and controls, blue edges on everything tappable and solid blue when on, a light and dark theme, and tabs that show how many are off-screen. The settings page is compact, fitting far more settings on screen, with a Code button by the presets that copies the settings code, and its window title names the script, version and channel.
- Quick Bar's coin readout shows the average medals earned per round.
- Share round stats setting added (Alpha): sends your round stats to a stats server you set on this script's card in GAP's Library, with network access allowed there.
- Resuming after a pause mid-round now presses Continue and returns to the round, instead of sometimes tapping Try Again or elsewhere on the pause menu.
- Tapping the Quick Bar's readout copies the run's figures to the clipboard: base coin and medal totals, averages, per-second rates and best and worst rounds, the round durations, and the round count.
- Receiving hearts one by one now always skips the ad mail, so the Skip first person setting is gone. Skill and premium ticket mail is left in the mailbox too.

### Added

- **GAP Companion notifications**: `gapNotify` (`src/companion.ts`) emits the
  reserved `gap.notify` event (`Emit.Companion.Notify`), which the companion
  server pushes to the phone (its `cloud/adapters/README.md` § Notifications).
  Sent by `wrapUpIfAsked` (`run` category, tag `run`), the three Now queues in
  `src/index.ts` from the sweep's outcome (`Tsum.lastChore`, set by the
  tasks) and Change My Tsum's queue (with a Try again button on failure).

- **Share round stats** (General, Alpha, off by default): the script now sends
  its own round stats (`src/roundShare.ts`) instead of handing the CSV pattern
  to the host's `publishStats`, which is gone. The server is the
  `ROUND_STATS_URL` env var declared in `gap-env.json` (new, shipped in
  `dist/` by the `dist:env` step); requests go out as
  `httpRequest('POST', 'env:ROUND_STATS_URL', …)` and the reply is read from
  a network event, so the round loop never waits on the server.
- **Change My Tsum** (GAP Companion action `selectTsum`, arg `tsum` from the
  `tsums` list): `selectMyTsumNow` saves the choice to
  `my_tsum_next_<device id>.json` and queues Select My Tsum as a one-shot task
  (`JobPriority.SelectTsumNow`) between rounds; with no run, the next
  non-workflow run's start queues it. Cleared once set or given up (a failed
  step is tried 3 times). Refused during a workflow or walkthrough. The Stats
  tab's My Tsum card shows the current and next MyTsum (`info.nextTsum`) and
  the button. Needs adapter 2.1.0.
- **Tsum List `favorite` column** (`1`/`0`, empty when the card would not
  select), off the gold/blue star by the panel portrait
  (`TsumListRegions.favorite`); the workflow list file carries it too, and
  the `tsums` list flags it (`GapWorkflowListItem.favorite`).
- **Quick Bar Medals row**: average medals per round, from the tally's medal reading, under Base and Final; a dash until a round earns some. The readout type is smaller so four rows fit the band.
- **Quick Bar readout copies the run's figures** (`qbCopyStats`,
  `src/quickbarPage.ts`): four lines through `setClipboard`, then a banner.
  `RunCoinTally` and `RunClock` grew min/max fields for it; the coin line is base
  coins, and the per-second rates are over time in rounds, not the wall clock. The host hotspot now covers the
  whole readout chip so the tap works mid-run.
- **GAP Companion workflows** (dormant until a sync arrives; `WORKFLOWS.md`).
  `src/gapWorkflow.ts` is the generic runner other scripts vendor; `src/workflow.ts`
  is Tsum's catalog and nodes, and `startWorkflow` a run mode that registers
  only the Workflow job. A whole Tsum List export also writes
  `tsum_list_<device id>.json`, which Select Tsum requires: Select My Tsum
  goes straight to the card's listed page and slot, confirms it with one read
  (`tsum-list-stale` otherwise) and taps MyTsum Set (its position still to
  verify on a device, INTL and JP). Pages mirror presets to
  `presets-<device id>.json` for Import. `npm run workflow:check`. Restart app
  walks the startup screens to the friend list before handing off.
- **GAP Companion screens** (`src/companionScreens.ts`, `gapScreens`): the
  phone's tabs, Stats cards (this run, a coins-per-round chart, recent
  rounds), event wording, My Tsum headline and Stop after this round button
  now come from the script (UI contract 3), so changing them needs no phone
  release. `round.over` carries `round`.
- **GAP Companion standard globals** (`src/companion.ts`): `gapCompanion`,
  `gapRemoteState`, `gapRemoteSet`, `gapRemoteAction`,
  `gapRemoteStartPrepare` / `gapRemoteStartRun`, `gapPresetsLocal` (was
  `presetsLocal`), read by the companion's one generic adapter instead of a
  Tsum adapter. The build signs `dist/` into `gap-signature.json` when
  `GAP_SCRIPT_KEY` is set (`tools/build/signScript.js`); adb pushes all of `dist/`.
- **Save One Mid Chain bubble strategy** (`BubbleStrategy.SaveOneMidChain`,
  share `S`, chip "Save 1 mid"). `popGameBubbles` on a long chain taps all but
  the richest (`richestFirst`), ripe or not; short post-skill hold; the
  overflow pop still applies.
- **Save One bubble strategy** (`BubbleStrategy.SaveOne`, share `s`, chip
  "Save 1"). `popBubbleOverflow` with keep 1 from 2 bubbles, right after each
  scan; the kept (richest) one is the budget-1 mid-chain pop. Short
  post-skill hold, as ASAP.
- **Large tsums.** About 1.85x a normal tsum across, too big for either circle
  pass, so they were missed or read as a stray small tsum. `findLargeTsums`
  now finds one by its flat colour from middle to rim (a colour grid, no Hough)
  and drops the stray circle inside it. `findTsums` samples it with the rest
  and `buildTsumNeighbors` reaches `LargeTsum.grow` farther for it, as the game
  does. Bubbles on a large tsum are not popped. A large *dark* tsum goes unseen.
  A hit must repeat at the same spot for 3 scans running, and none is taken for 1.5s after a skill
  (`LargeTsum.skillQuietMs`), whose animation dims the board. Nothing here is
  per skill: a large tsum can turn up under any of them.
  `board.largeTsums` logs what was found. Checked on one recording only.
- **Trace stream** (`src/trace.ts`, host 3.1+). With a consumer on the host's
  trace port, every log record (debug included, flood guard bypassed) plus
  `board.scan` and `board.paths` snapshots stream live via `emitTrace`; the log
  file is unchanged. The host adds every capture (`frame.*`) and touch
  (`input.*`), `board.scan` names its frame, and the hearts sweep sends `marks`.
  Unwatched, it costs one `traceAttached()` call a second.
- **App restart frequency** stored in minutes (was hours; a saved `6` is now 6 min), moved from Experimental to Device.
- **Last run settings.** `start()` writes its settings, minus the one-shot
  flags, to `last-settings-<getDeviceId()>.json` in the script folder; a failed
  write only warns. `lastRunSettings()` reads it back, or null.
- **Stop after this round** (Quick Bar page two, "Last round"). A run-time
  flag (`Tsum.wrapUpAsked`), never saved: `stopAfterThisRound()` /
  `cancelStopAfterThisRound()` arm it; it fires at the round's tail
  (`countGameTowardStop`), before a round starts, or via the `wrapUpNow` job
  when no round is being played. Reported as `stopAfterThisRound` in
  `quickBarState`.
- **NBC Set board scale** (`SkillType.NightmareSet`; the skill shipped in 4.0). A burst
  declaring `scalesBoard`: each scan reads tsum spacing (ALT Hough, median of
  5) into `Config.boardScale`, which scales the circle pass, blurs, texture
  disc, bubble pass and link reach. Other skills skip the read and stay at 1.
- **Disney Villains (Set)** (`SkillType.VillainsSet`, Alpha). A burst declaring
  `colorBlur` 15 and the new `SkillHandler.chromaCap` 80, which caps each
  tsum's sampled saturation in `findTsums`. Its neon board split one villain
  over many clusters; offline, linkable tsums per board 6.4 -> 10.9.
- **NBC Set: Oogie Boogie's dice.** Any touch during his roll rerolls it once.
  Each board scan looks for his green cut-in (`SkillHandler.watchScan`); from
  there every touch is held, both dice are read at rest (`nbcLook`), and a first
  total under 7 gets one mid-board tap. The tsum size then follows the roll
  (`Tsum.boardScaleTrend`: 7+ shrink only, under 7 grow only).
- `SkillHandler.colorBlur`: NBC Set narrows the colour blur so Sally does not
  cluster with Jack and Zero.
- **`npm run buildAndAdb:beta`** pushes a Beta-channel build, to preview what
  Alpha hides.
- **Stop after games** (`SettingKey.StopAfterGames`, `StopAfterAction`). Counted
  at the play task's tail (`countGameTowardStop`); firing or a new target resets
  the count. Auto Play off removes the `PlayRound` job; Pause calls the host's
  new `pauseScript()` (falls back to Auto Play off on an older host). Both are
  `LiveWhen.Now`, `neverShared`.
- **Quick Bar** page two's bottom row is now Games and Then; the five bonus
  chips there are gone (still on the settings page).

### Changed

- **Host renamed General Automation Platform** in docs, comments and
  `package.json`. Folder, repo and package names keep `GameAutomationPlatform`.
- **`MinHost` raised to 3.1** (`config.json`): the app will not download or
  run this build on an older host. 3.1 is where the named host calls below
  arrived, so the script uses them unguarded rather than keeping a shell
  fallback behind every `typeof`.
- **Everything the script writes moved into this device's own folder.**
  `Tsum.devicePath` is `getDevicePath()` (`<root>/devices/<name>_<id>`) and
  replaces `storagePath` at every write site. Several emulator instances
  routinely share one root -- MuMu does by default -- so a fixed path under it
  meant each instance overwriting the last. The grouping folder went with it,
  since it is redundant once each device has its own: `Config.statsDir`
  (`stats`) replaces `recordDir` (`tsum_record`), `pageHistory` became
  `history`, `record.txt` became `hearts.json`, and `corpus`, `reports`,
  `walkthrough` and `tmp` sit directly under the device folder. Old files are
  left alone; Tsum Tsum Stats walks the tree, so it still imports them.
- **No `execute()` anywhere in the script.** The shell commands became named
  host calls: `makeDirs`, `listDir`, `removeFile`, `copyFile` for the
  filesystem; `foregroundApp`, `isInstalled`, `launchApp`, `stopApp` for the
  game; `deviceInfo` for the report's device block (one call, not a dozen
  `getprop`s); `dumpUi` for the dialog path's view hierarchy; `touchDevices`
  and `readTouch` for Click Assist. The host composes each command, which is
  steadier across devices, and `statsShellValue` and the `getevent` parsing
  are gone with them.
- **`statsDeviceTag` no longer probes the shell.** `getDeviceId()` is always
  there at 3.1, so the `android_id`/`serialno` hash it fell back to on an older
  host is gone; the cached file and a random tag remain for a host that somehow
  answers nothing.
- **Auto Play Game is live** (`LiveWhen.Now`): `quickBarSyncJob` removes the
  PlayRound job (sweeps keep running) or re-adds it with the sweeps it brings.
  The Quick Bar's side column swaps Report for its toggle; `qbReport` and the
  `quickBar.report*` log events are gone. A workflow owns the setting.
- **DEV deploys are named.** `--adb` pushes a `.gap-install.json` naming the
  folder `Tsum Tsum DEV - <local deploy time>`; the host's list shows that
  instead of `DEV`.
- **Compact settings page.** A 44px app bar over a slim tab row (version
  moved to the foot); 32px controls (`--ctl`), smaller type and padding, no
  720px width cap. Below the kit's sizes on purpose (`DEVELOPMENT.md`). The
  bar's Code button copies the share code (`copySettingsCodeFromBar`), opening
  the share panel if the clipboard fails. `PANEL_TITLE` names the script,
  version and channel for the host's panel header (host 3.0 reads it).
- **Collection scrubber.** The track under the grid jumps to the first page
  when tapped at its left end, the last at its right (`CollectionGrid.scrubFirst`
  / `scrubLast`). `rewindCollection` taps it first, keeping the chevron bursts
  as fallback; `skipCollectionToEnd` is new. Select My Tsum comes from the last
  page and turns back (`tsumListTurnPage(run, true)`) when that is fewer turns
  and the last card is still the list's last tsum (`selectMyTsumEndMatches`);
  otherwise it walks from page 1. Untested on a device.
- **Bubble popping.** Measured on a Villains Set recording: the scan found
  about half of a packed bottom row, and the 2s post-skill hold blocked pops
  for ~30% of the round.
  - `findGameBubbles` adds a looser bottom-band pass (`bandFrom`) filtered by
    `bubbleLooks`; both moved out of Gaston, which now shares them.
  - All Bubbles ASAP skips `ripeGameBubbles` and holds only
    `shortHoldAfterSkillMs` (600ms) after a skill. Its blind sweep fires when a
    scan sees `pileUpSweepAt` bubbles (was: two "bubble events") and covers the
    bottom band only.
  - One/All Mid Chain: `popBubbleOverflow` pops all but the `overflowKeep` (2)
    richest once a scan sees `overflowAt` (4).
- **Quick Bar enum checks.** `quickBarApply` refuses a value an enum setting
  lacks (skill, bubble strategy, box type/size, the two stop actions) with
  `{ok:false, why:"invalid value"}` and a `quickBar.invalidValue` warning.
- Gaston, Coronation Day Elsa and `SkillReactivationTenths` to Production.
- Quick Bar: the skill name no longer widens its column (`.qb-cell-fit`), so a
  long name ellipsises at the bonus cluster instead of pushing the side column.
- Tsum List export writes a `device` column: the host's `getDeviceName()`, the
  name its events carry, so GAP Stats can filter its Catalog by device. Empty on
  a host without it.
- `checkSkillReadiness` reads Far while the bottom chrome is green or purple
  smoke. Villains (Set)'s smoke read Active at the button, so `while (useSkill())`
  re-fired every ~300ms and drew no chains for up to 9s per window. The Quick
  Bar's grey strip hides that chrome, so the side margins at y 1700 back it up.
- **GAP Design System** on both pages. Pico is gone: `index.css` and
  `quickbar.css` use only `src/gapTokens.css` (the kit's tokens, copied
  verbatim). Fonts are Latin woff2 subsets in `src/fonts/`, inlined by the
  build as data URIs. Dark is the default theme.
- **Design kit v2.** Tokens re-copied; fonts are now Inter / Inter Display
  (opsz instances, subset with fonttools) plus IBM Plex Mono. Blue `tap` edge
  marks tappable, solid `selected` marks on; settings groups are flat
  read-only cards and controls inside them are fill only. Text sizes kept a
  step above the kit's so legibility matches. Quick Bar reaches full size at
  460dp (was 440) because Inter runs wider than Plex.
- Settings tabs scroll as pills with "+N" overflow cues (`updateTabOverflow`);
  stepper buttons turn dashed at the row's min/max (`syncStepLimits`).
- Quick Bar toggles are solid blue with a check; "applies now" is green,
  "next round" amber; coin and time figures use the data colours.
- **Ad mail stepped past, not opened.** `outReceiveOneAd` is an always-on
  `mailRowToOpen` skip (`gifts.receiveOne.skipAd`), and rows are found
  whenever `MailBox` shows, not only under Skip Medals / Skip Ruby or when
  `outReceiveOne` reads gold -- on the ad row it reads the film icon, which
  left the loop spinning to its 100-pass limit. Removed with it: the
  `receiveHeartsSkipFirst` setting, the start-time `outReceive*` y patching
  (the y's are fixed in `data.ts`), and `skipAd`'s blind delete taps.

### Fixed

- **Base coins unread on a '6'.** The dimmed level-up counter draws a '6' with a
  filled lower loop that led '8' by under the margin; it now has a second '6'
  shape (`6b`), and the margin is measured to another digit.
- **Resume mid-round tapped the pause menu.** A paused run is parked inside its
  next touch, so on Resume the rest of a chain planned before the pause landed on
  the pause menu (Try Again, To Home Screen) before the loop pressed Continue.
  New `onResume()` host hook (host: `ScriptRuntime.runResumeHook`, before the
  flag lifts) presses Continue and waits for the board; `onPause` records the
  pause (`ts.pauses`, `pausedAt`, `pausedInRound`); `link` drops the rest of a
  batch a pause landed under; the paused time is credited to `roundStartedAt`.
- **Rank-up panel stalled the score wait.** The ranking panel read `ClosePage`,
  which nothing taps during the wait; it now has its own page (`RankUp`) and
  `dismiss.rankUp` closes it.
- **Last-seconds edge wash no longer breaks chains.** The game washes the
  screen edges cyan ~0.55s of every second in the last 5s; edge tsums read the
  wrong colour then. `waitOutEdgeWash` waits for the dim part before planning
  (max 800ms).
- **NBC Set roll handling**: no skill-loop taps during Oogie's roll
  (`beforeActivate`); the wait ends 0.5s after he and the dice are gone
  (`NbcDice.goneMs`); a first roll must hold 250ms before a reroll
  (`NbcDice.settleMs`); pip thresholds fit the device's `findContours`
  outline area (`pipMinRel` 0.006, `pipMinFill` 0.45; harness shim matches).
  Temporarily each first roll is saved to `<storage>/tmp/nbc-dice-*.png`
  (`nbcSaveRoll`).
- **NBC Set board scale** takes the nearest 0.05 step over a 9-read median once
  3 reads are in, with no dead-band; the radius read is used only while growing.
- `TsumLevelUpSingleTsum` moved two probes off the icon column and the "x2"
  badge. Villains (Set)'s level-up read as unknown, so base coins were never
  sampled and the tally wait gave up with the panel still up: every stats field blank.
- `LevelUpMyTsumCard`: lone-card padlock read at top + 104 (was 119, below the
  lock) and column x 511 (515 was the lock's edge). A capped single-tsum party was
  never seen, so Auto Unlock MyTsum Level never raised it.

## [5.0a1]

### Summary

- Tsum List export added (Chores > Tsum List > Now): writes every Tsum you own, with its level, skill level, progress to the next skill level and month acquired, to a CSV.

### Added

- **Tsum List export** (`src/tsumList.ts`). Sorts the collection by Date acquired
  with owned Tsums only, rewinds, taps each card, and writes
  `stats/tsum_list_<stamp>.csv` after every page. Queued on a live run.
  Started from a stopped script (`SettingKey.TsumListOnly`), the run exports and
  stops. Alpha.
- The Tsum List CSV ends in a `build` column (`global`/`jp`), so a reader such
  as the stats site can tell an INTL list from a JP one.
- `round.start` and `round.end` carry `build`, and `round.end` also `myTsum` and
  `skill`, so a live consumer can file a round without waiting for its CSV row.
- **Naming** is by portrait first: `src/tsumsCollection.dat`, rendered from
  each tsum's `_l` art. When the portrait can't separate art twins (Donald and
  his variants, the Minnies, Piglet), the name printed on the panel decides:
  `src/tsumNames.dat`, from the game's `win_tsumname_<id>` strips. On emulator
  this named all 355 of 355 correctly, 350 of them by portrait alone.
- **`skill_progress`**: percent through the current skill level, read off where
  the skill bar's yellow fill ends (fitted on 25/37/50/75%, all within 0.2%).
  Empty at MAX. Reads ~2 points high near 0%.
- The level row ends short of the "x2" badge some tsums wear beside it.
- After a card is tapped, the export waits for the portrait to change and then
  hold still before reading it (`awaitCollectionPortrait`). For ~270ms the old
  portrait holds still, so a stillness check alone reads the previous tsum.
- **`src/tsumsCollection.dat`**: the portrait fallback, rendered from the `_l`
  art. On its own it named only 4 of 39 live panels: many panels draw a
  different image, such as McQueen's side view.
- **Digit reader**: a `StatsRegion` can read `/` as a field break (`slash`) and
  enlarge small text (`scale`). The collection's 9px dates are read under five
  floor/scale pairs until two agree.

### Changed

- `sortCollection` can also set "Show owned Tsums only" and returns the dialog's
  previous state; `restoreCollectionSort` puts both back.
- `collectionOffersRaise` is split out of `raiseSelectedLevelCap`. The export
  also uses it, because the level row moves right when the padlock is drawn.

## [3.0b5]

### Summary

- Settings page reorganized: Skills, Round (chain limits and bonuses) and Hearts are the first three tabs, the run settings moved to General, and setting descriptions are shorter.
- Japanese (日本語) added as a language for the settings page, Quick Bar and log.
- Copy with settings list option added: a copied settings code can carry a short list of its skill type and the settings changed from default.
- Quick Bar gained a second page, switched by the dots beside Report: heart sending and one-by-one receiving, Unlock now, Copy settings code and the other bonus items; the coin readout has its own toggle to show round/run times.
- Sending hearts through the ranking is faster, and hearts sent without a "Heart sent!" popup are now counted.

### Added

- **Japanese** (`ja-JP`): `src/uiJa.ts` and `src/logsJa.ts`. Bubbles are ボム, as in
  the Japanese game. Skill, box and Quick Bar labels stay English, as in zh-TW;
  every log sentence is translated.
- **Copy with settings list** (General > Settings code). A page-only switch in
  localStorage (`tsumtsumsharelisting`), not a setting. When on, Copy puts the
  skill type and the rows that differ from default on one line under the code; the QR stays the
  bare code and paste still reads only the code.
- **Quick Bar page two**, flipped by a toggle stacked over Report (`.qb-side`),
  so it costs no width; Report is now glyph-only. Both pages share one grid
  area so the strip does not jump. The hotspot now covers the whole side
  column, so pages can be switched mid-run.
- **Hearts toggles are live.** `sendHeartsAuto` and `receiveHeartsOneByOne` are
  `LiveWhen.Now`; `quickBarSyncJob` adds or removes their job using
  `runTaskTable`'s spec. The settings panel gets this too.
- **Strip actions.** Lvl (an open padlock) calls `unlockLevelsNow()`; Copy code broadcasts
  `PageMessage.CopyShareCode` and the settings page (which owns the codec)
  copies from the store and answers `ShareCodeCopied`/`NotCopied`. Both chips
  sweep (`data-busy`, `qbBusyStart`/`qbBusyEnd`) until answered, and the outcome
  is a banner rather than a colour. The strip's banners and log lines go through
  `runScriptCallback`: a `runScript` counts as a run, and its end cleared them.
- **Readout toggle**: two stacked dots on the coin readout's left edge flip
  `<body data-readout>` between the coins and times tables, independent of the
  page. `qbNameHotspot` sends one rect covering the side column and this toggle.
- **`ts.runClock`** counts round time at every round end (stats on or off) for
  the readout's times table.

### Changed

- **Settings tabs regrouped** as Skills, Round, Hearts, Gameplay, Chores,
  General, Debug. Round holds chains per scan, max chain and the bonuses.
  Run-level rows (auto launch/play, round delay, max round, stats, app restart)
  moved to General; Advanced is gone. `SHARE_TABS` now covers Round, so share
  codes and presets carry the same rows as before.
- **Setting help text shortened** to about one line each, English and
  Chinese; conflicts, coin/ruby spending and what 0 means are kept.
- **Faster heart sweep.** `dragList` settles on `settleScreen` instead of a
  fixed 900ms rest (mail scrolls too), and the extra 400ms rest after each
  friend-list scroll is gone. A send whose toast never shows (~6% on BlueStacks,
  each ~5s of polling) now ends once its row turns blue, and is counted. The
  row turns blue ~0.5s before the toast, so that wait is `HeartNoToastPolls`,
  and a screenful that reads empty after sending clears any late toast before
  scrolling past its rows.

## [3.0b4]

### Summary

- Fixed Box Buying stalling on the box's reveal card while the Quick Bar is up.
- Delay Skill ReActivation setting added: holds a full gauge for a set time after each activation so a skill with a duration is not wasted.
- Wait for Settle is now set in seconds (0.0-3.0) instead of milliseconds.

### Added

- **Delay Skill ReActivation** (Skills tab, Beta). Stored as
  `skillReactivationTenths`; `skillStillRunning` refuses an activation within
  it of `useSkill`'s last tap, so every activation path honours it. Live on the
  next activation; last share slot. Number rows gained `scale` so a tenths value
  shows as seconds.

### Changed

- **Wait for Settle shown in seconds.** Still stored as `skillSettleMs`, so
  saved settings and share codes carry over; the row uses `scale: 1000`. Scaled
  rows now show one decimal, step by 0.1 on the fine buttons and open a decimal
  keypad.
- **`build --adb` pushes to every emulator in `adb devices`** instead of a
  hardcoded serial; `--device SERIAL` still picks one.

### Fixed

- **Box reveals close under the Quick Bar.** The strip hides the reveal card's
  foot probe, so the card read only as `ClosePage` and `clearBoxReveals` tapped
  the blind advance forever. It now presses Close on `ClosePage` too.

## [3.0b3]

### Summary

- Fixed Unlock Level and Box Buying repeating back to back instead of waiting their set hours, and Unlock Level missing capped Tsums when the collection opened past its first page.

### Fixed

- **Unlock Level and Box Buying no longer loop.** Their `true` ("ran" for the
  Now queue) reached the scheduler as "due again next pass"; `taskBody` now
  drops it. A device ran the sweep every ~7s for hours.
- **The level-cap rewind waits for the grid to load.** After a re-sort the grid
  shows placeholder cards for ~0.5s with no left chevron, so the first-page
  check said yes on any page and the sweep read nothing capped.
  `awaitCollectionLoaded` polls `CollectionGrid.loading*` before rewinding.

## [3.0b2]

### Summary

- The next round starts about 3 seconds sooner after the score tally, and the tally's count-up is now skipped with round stats off too.
- Gaston skill improved and moved to Beta.
- Fixed Unlock Level and Box Buying repeating back to back instead of waiting their set hours, and Unlock Level missing capped Tsums when the collection opened past its first page.

### Fixed

- **The play job is due again as soon as a round ends.** The scheduler stamps
  `lastRunTime` after a job returns, so the play job's 3s interval kept the
  finished tally on screen for 3s before Play was pressed. A job may now return
  `true` to be due on the next pass; `taskPlayGameQuick` does after a round.
  The count-up tap itself worked -- on the device it cut ~0.6s off a count-up
  under a second long.
- **The count-up tap is retried after 400ms, not 1000ms.** With stats off the
  first look at the tally comes straight off the level-up panel, mid-fade, and
  the game drops that tap; the count-up (~1.25s) had ended before the retry.

## [3.0b]

### Summary

- New "Wait for Settle" setting on the Skills tab: once the gauge fills, waits up to a chosen number of milliseconds (steps of 200) for the board to refill before firing the skill, popping bubbles into a board still moving as the Bubble Strategy allows, so it goes off on a full board rather than a half-empty one.
- Bubbles are no longer popped the moment they appear or right after a skill fires, when the burst has left nothing round them to clear; the Bubble Strategy spends them once the board has refilled.
- The score tally's count-up is tapped through whether or not round stats are being recorded, so the next round starts sooner.
- Box Buying can buy the Pick-Up Capsule: pick it under "Box to buy" and the sweep buys from the capsule while one is on sale, opening each and closing its prize, whether a tsum or an item, closes the Last Prize the final capsule hands out, and stops once the capsule is sold out.

### Added

- **`BoxType.Capsule` -- the Pick-Up Capsule under "Box to buy".** It shares
  the store's limited-time tab with the Select Box, so `readBoxTabs` reads
  the tab's icon (`BoxStore.capsuleIcon`: the machine's red base, either side
  of its gold plate) and reports `limited` -- `capsule` or `select` -- which
  `openBoxTab` puts in the slot; a player who picked one never buys the
  other. The capsule sells singly, so any size buys one at a time. Its
  confirmation (`ConfirmPurchaseCapsulePage`) is retuned to today's "Left: N"
  dialog on the cyan bands instead of the dome gradient; the reveal loop taps
  through "TAP! OPEN!" and the ~9s spin blind, and closes either the reveal
  card (a tsum) or the game's GET! dialog, `EventGift` (an item), which it
  now treats like the card. The last capsule follows its GET! with "Last
  Prize!" over the store -- the same dialog, another title -- which the first
  device run stuck on: `EventGiftLastPrize` (`EventGift`'s `lastPrize`
  configuration) carries the GET! entry's chrome with two probes on the wider
  title, thresholds sized to the sparkles that play over it, and the loop
  closes it like the rest. The sold-out store reads as it does for a box (the
  tab's ribbon stops above the icon probes; the button is blue), so the next
  pass ends on `box.soldOut`. The tab read, the confirmation, the spin and
  the GET! Close ran on MuMu; the Last Prize entry and the sold-out pass are
  proven on the device's own captures only.

- **`src/chainCounter.ts`: every measured drag reads the game's own chain
  counter.** The number the game draws beside a chain's head is its outline
  (`game_num_48_blue` over the white plate) boxed off a navy mask, sampled to
  a 20x28 grid and scored against `ChainDigits`, templates the development
  toolkit's `chain:digits` renders from the sprite itself. Read with the
  finger still down, `settleMs` after the last MOVE. Gaston's passes log it
  as `registered` beside `chain` (and `skill.gaston.done` lists both), with
  `counter` saying where the number sat and what else was on the frame, and
  `registeredLate` a held chain's count again before its release; the play
  loop's chains log `board.chainDrawn` under a skill that sets
  `SkillHandler.readsChainCounter`, which Gaston does. Nine recordings of his
  drag were tuned without this number ever being in the log.
- **`SettingKey.SkillSettleMs`.** `useSkill` runs `settleBoard` with the
  setting as the budget and no floor between the gauge read and the activation
  tap, ahead of the fever hold-off and `beforeActivate` -- the tap goes out the
  moment the tsums have landed, or at the deadline. Milliseconds rather than
  fractional seconds because a share code carries whole numbers. Live (`Now`,
  read per activation), in share codes, presets and the stats CSV, and a Run
  order chip when set. With it on, `maybeAutoTapSkill` stops blind-tapping
  `bareTapActivates` skills and reads the gauge instead, since a blind tap
  cannot wait for the board. `skill.use` carries `settleMs` (what the wait
  took) and `settled`.
- **`settleBoard` takes an `onMoving` callback**, run once at the first reading
  that shows the tsums moving. The settle look above uses it to
  `popGameBubbles()` -- the Bubble Strategy's own budget, under the same
  hold after an activation as `link` -- so a board found refilling gets its
  bubbles spent into the drop, and a board already still keeps them.

### Changed

- **The tally's count-up tap is a dispatch handler, not `waitForScorePage`'s.**
  `dismiss.tallyCountUp` fires on every look that names the tally -- the play
  loop's, a chore's, `navigate`'s -- where with stats off nothing aimed a tap
  at the count-up at all, only `nav.move.exit`'s Close at a button not yet
  drawn. `record.tallyRow` (`readTallyRow`) reads the button row, the medals row
  and Play off one frame into `Tsum.tallyRow`; the count-up tap, the Play
  shortcut (`nav.move.tallyToGame`, which used to capture its own frame through
  `tallyPlayShown`) and the stats read (`roundMedalsRow` is gone) all read that.
  Each tap logs `page.scorePage.skipping` and is followed by a settle, so the
  next look reads the finished row; `stats.tallySkipped` still sums them.
- **Gaston's route is the longest path over the Gastons, from wherever it
  starts.** `gastonChain` runs `findLongestTsumPath` over every component of
  the free board under `GastonConfig.searchSteps`. The snake from a top corner
  (`gastonSnake`, `gastonRows`, `gastonHops`, `rowGap`, `rowHeight`,
  `snakeSteps`) is gone: on the device a route forced from the corner ran
  upward into dead ends, into bubbles and back over itself, and the game
  stopped linking there. Replayed over 725 logged boards it plans 15,917 tsums
  to the snake's 15,743. `skill.gaston.pass` carries `bubbleAt`, the bubble
  centres, so a hop across one can be checked offline.
- **Gaston's route is planned over the tsums the game paints, from the head
  the finger is on.** `gaston_8.mp4` aligned to its log: the colour cluster
  held Donald, the Cheshire Cat and an orange tsum on most boards under the
  fever tint, every route through one stalled or lost its head (the six held
  chains registered 7-19 of 24-37), and the head check's eight far probes
  were mostly those same tsums, so it read live heads dead 27 times in 40 and
  each lift popped a chain of three. Now `gastonLinkChain` lands on the head,
  waits `paintMs`, and reads every circle's floor rise (`gastonFloorRead`,
  `paintRise`): what rose is Gaston, the route is `gastonChainFrom` over
  those, a head that painted nothing is lifted with one tsum under it and the
  pass tries another (`deadRetries`). No read inside `paintBlackoutMs` of the
  close; a pass that cannot read plans off the last read's leftovers
  (`gastonCarry`, `carryMatch`, pruned by each cancel's blast), else the
  cluster. `skill.gaston.pass` now logs the whole scan as `board`, with
  `painted`, `head`, `source` and `carried`; `deadAt` is gone.
- **Gaston's hops cross nothing.** The game links along the line between two
  MOVEs and takes a line back over the previous link as undoing it (a 37 planned
  registered 7 that way). `gastonNeighbors` keeps only hops whose segment
  passes no other tsum's centre within `crossAvoid` nor a bubble; replayed over
  103 logged boards the routes plan 99.5% of the unfiltered length.
- **Gaston's drag starts from the route's higher end.** `gaston_7.mp4` aligned
  to its log: five of seven dead drags began on a leftover at the bottom of
  the pile, where a longest path's tip lands. `gastonOrient` draws from the
  higher end, an end touching a known leftover losing (`frontierAvoid`).
- **Gaston's window is two cancelled chains, then one held through the
  close.** A chain released while the skill still runs charges nothing, even
  the part of its clear that pops after the close, so after `passesBeforeHold`
  cancelled passes the next chain's finger stays on its last tsum until
  `holdPastCloseMs` past the estimated close (`gastonLinkChain`), and from the
  release the button is spammed until the gauge reads full (`gastonSpamSkill`,
  replacing `gastonAwaitGauge` and the chain drawn after the close). Bubbles
  are the skill's from the first activation to the tally
  (`claimsBubbles` off `roundStartedAt`) and the Bubble Strategy's before it;
  the cancel spends every bubble (`bubbleReserve` 0, since each activation
  leaves one), the one over the most leftovers first (`gastonBubbleWorth`,
  logged as `near`). `skill.gaston.pass` carries `heldMs`; the done record
  carries `heldMs`, `releaseLeadMs` and `spamTaps` in place of `charged`.
- **The hold after a skill activation is two seconds from the tap, not one
  scan.** `GameBubbleConfig.holdAfterSkillMs` replaces `settleScansAfterSkill`.
  `useSkill` stamps it at the activation, so an auto-tapped skill is covered
  too (only the play loop's own path stamped the old one), and
  `bubbleTapBudget`, `link`'s per-chain pops and the All Bubbles ASAP sweep
  all honour it (`bubble.heldAfterSkill`). A blind-tapped burst reads the
  button once after the tap while bubbles are on the board: still Active means
  it fired, so the hold is stamped and the scan's bubbles dropped
  (`skill.blindTapFired`). A skill's own pops and sweeps are untouched.
- **A bubble is held for a second after it is first seen**
  (`GameBubbleConfig.minAgeMs`). The blast count is one frame's reading, and a
  burst's bubble first shows mid-clear, where it can read surrounded over a
  hole -- Ariel+ popped hers the instant she made them. `trackGameBubbles`
  carries sightings across scans by position (`GameBubble.firstSeen`), and the
  unripe release is per bubble by age (`unripeReleaseMs`, 3s) instead of five
  consecutive scans. `bubble.found` and `bubble.unripe` carry `age`.
- **`gaston.ts`'s comments trimmed** to what the code needs: recording notes,
  measurements and history removed (3416 to 2522 lines, no code change).
- **Gaston's disabled fever dodges removed.** The fever-switch and fever
  start/end waits (`dodgeSwitch`, `dodgeFever`), their rescan and the per-hop
  steps (`stepsPerHop`, `pacedMoves`) were all off; `skill.gaston.pass` drops
  `waitedMs`, `replanned`, `fever`, `feverWaitMs` and `feverRing`. The antler
  read stays (`gastonWatchAntlers`, `antlerProbe`).
- **Gaston's Debug-tab experiments removed**: Drag dwell, Board colour model
  (radial) and Merge cluster fragments. The paint read replaced them; the scan
  no longer reads each tsum's rim drop.

### Fixed

- **Gaston's route is the board's biggest colour cluster, and nothing else.**
  The palette -- learned by size on the window's first board, matched by colour
  after -- is gone with `gastonPalette`, `paletteShare`, `paletteMinShare`,
  `paletteDistance` and the pass record's `palette`. A recorded round read
  chain by chain (`gaston_2.mp4`) had ten of 21 chains start on a leftover the
  palette had admitted, by size on a board still half leftovers or by colour
  within the scan's merge distance, and link one to four tsums of 17-33
  planned; a fever-tinted board also left one window scanning 18 passes at 4
  matched tsums. A route over one cluster is at worst a chain of one leftover
  colour.
- **Gaston's drags stay out of the fever switch, where the game stops
  linking.** The game takes no link for 0.5-0.75s as the fever backdrop
  switches, and a drag under way loses its head there: `gaston_4.mp4` had 33
  planned register 11 with the drawn line frozen for 1.1s, and `gaston_6.mp4`
  had the fever's exit land inside four of eight held chains (13, 9, 14 and 24
  of 32, 22, 24 and 30 planned), two of which then never filled the gauge. The
  exit is predictable -- the backdrop comes on 1.3s after the tap as the face
  fades (`faceMs`) and stays exactly 8.35s (`feverMs`, nine of nine) -- so a
  drag that would straddle it waits for the switch and the freeze behind it
  (`gastonAwaitSwitch`, `switchFreezeMs`), and a switch seen just before any
  drag holds it the rest; the backdrop is read as the chrome beside the score
  not being its plain-board colour (`plainChrome`), since each fever theme
  paints its own there. Two approaches to the freeze came first. A synchronous
  MOVE at the host (`moveTo`'s `wait` flag, Gaston's `pacedMoves`) on the
  theory that the UI thread blocked and the moves batched: measured at ~2ms a
  hop with the chains dying all the same, so the freeze is the game's own; the
  flag is off. And a probe of the coin the game draws on a
  linked tsum, with a hold on a miss, which lost more than it saved
  (`gaston_5.mp4`: 13 chains in a round where the one before drew 23) -- the
  scan's centres sit ~14px off the sprites, and the game reads a finger
  returning to the previous tsum as undoing the last link. `stepsPerHop` is 0:
  a midpoint sample linked neighbours out of order. `skill.gaston.pass`
  carries `dragMs`, `overMs` (the wait on the game beyond the dwells),
  `waitedMs` (the hold-back from a switch) and `fever`. `GastonConfig.dodgeSwitch`
  false turns the hold-back off while the backdrop is still watched, so `fever`
  still says which drags went out under one.
- **Gaston's charge opens the next window itself, and no activation goes out
  inside a window.** The spam tap's read of a full gauge was handed to
  `useSkill` for the tap, but once the button has fired the empty gauge
  behind its flash reads empty, so `useSkill` saw no activation and the play
  loop played the window: `gaston_6.mp4` had it chain a Gaston board for
  eleven seconds, and once fire a second activation four seconds into a
  window, wasting the rest of it. `afterActivate` now runs `gastonWindow`
  after `gastonWindow` while each charge fires the next, anchoring each at
  the read that saw the gauge full and logging `skill.use` with `charged`;
  and `SkillHandler.stillRunning`, which Gaston answers until the window can
  have closed, makes `useSkill` and `maybeAutoTapSkill` leave a full gauge
  alone (`skill.stillRunning`). The spam loop stops when the round ends under
  it, and a pass whose scan reads well under the board the gate just saw full
  rescans for up to `flashRetryMs` (`rescans` in the pass record) -- the fever
  label's flash read 29 of 40 and drew a chain of 5.
- **Gaston's drag is the play loop's, 10/10/10 and unpaced.** It dwelt 40ms
  a tsum with a paced MOVE for a while, on `gaston_3.mp4`'s finding that an
  18ms dwell registered 279 of 456 planned -- measured on the snake route,
  whose reach-length hops and back-crossings the crossing-free route has
  since removed. At 40ms a thirty-chain was 1.3s and the window's three
  passes outran its six seconds: the device log of 2026-09-21
  (`muc2hht99b`) had the closing drag out 1.2-3.8s past the close in every
  window, while the play loop's 10ms chains ran the same Gaston boards
  whole between windows. A thirty-chain is ~0.35s.
- **A Gaston chain with no bubble to cancel it is held when its pop would
  refill past the close.** The pass used to wait out the pop
  (`chain * popPerTsumMs + popTailMs`, 3.4s for a thirty) and draw the next
  chain on the refill; past the close that refill is leftovers. Three of six
  windows in `muc2hht99b` lost their charge that way, and the next
  activation then opened on a full board of leftovers. `gastonLinkChain`
  now asks a `holds` rule at the head -- the tail, or no bubble and the pop
  running past `closesAt` -- in place of `cancelBefore`.
- **Gaston's cancels no longer tap the HUD buttons.** The hem the bubble
  capture runs below the play square brings in the two round buttons under the
  bowl, read as bubbles on every pass; `hemButtons` names them and
  `gastonNotButtons` drops them, so a cancel lands on a bubble in play and a
  pass with none waits out the pop.
- **Gaston's routes keep clear of the bubbles resting on the bowl.** Four
  recordings at dwell 10/20/34 (2026-09-21), the planned route drawn over
  the frames: every chain that died mid-drag died on a bubble the pass had
  not read -- the Hough pass loses the resting ones under the rim lights, the
  scan reads a bubble's icons as a tsum, and the paint read passed it.
  `gastonBubbles` now adds a second Hough at `bandParam2` over the bowl's
  bottom (`band`) and the round's memory of every read
  (`gastonRememberBubbles`, `soft`), both planned round. The pass record
  carries `band`, `soft` and every circle's paint `rises`. Clean routes
  registered whole at 10ms, so the dwell was not the lever. The first run on
  this charged 13 windows of 18 (5 of 23 before); `bubbleAvoid` was 1.4
  widths for that run and cut a full board into routes of 4-13, so it is
  back at 1.0.
- **The band's bubbles are tapped as cancels.** They were `soft` too at
  first, and the resting ones stood untouched: over six runs on 2026-09-22,
  30 of the 35 chains released without a cancel had bubbles on the board,
  all soft, 66 of the 78 in the band and read hard by the next pass often
  enough. `gastonCancelBubble` and the no-bubble hold now count the band's
  finds (`gastonTappableBubbles`); only the memory's stay untapped, since a
  remembered bubble may have rolled when a clear went out from under it.
- **A starved carry falls back to the cluster.** The window's first read
  finds a board of leftovers; the first clear slides them into the positions
  the carry remembered and the Gastons that land read as leftovers too, so
  221 of 291 passes that day planned nothing and six windows of 23 drew no
  chain at all. A pass whose carry leaves nothing plans from the colour
  cluster and drops the carry until the next read (`starved` on the record).
- **Gaston's window checks each step instead of assuming it.** On
  2026-09-23 (`mudehgre4r`) three passes went uncancelled with a remembered
  bubble on the board, and six charges failed. After each failed charge the
  next activation opened on leftovers, and it took windows to recover. A
  cancel is now checked off the tsum count (`cancelDrop`). One that did not
  take taps the remembered bubbles too, then waits out the pop instead of
  planning over it. The charge stops spamming once the held clear is over
  (`chargeTailMs`), and a short chain is followed by other colours' chains
  (`mixedChains`).
- **Gaston's chains without a paint read are planned over his colour cluster,
  less the carry.** `gaston_100.mp4` (2026-09-23), aligned to its log, had
  three of four failed charges on held chains planned without a read over
  tsums that were not his. The carry alone took everything dropped since the
  read for Gaston, so two ran through Lotsos and Stitches. On the third,
  reads had been switched off after three lifted heads that *had* painted.
  Now only heads that painted nothing (`blank`) switch reads off, as the
  header always said.
- **Gaston's pass scans again after waiting out the fever switch, and a missed
  cancel reads the board again.** `gaston_101.mp4` (2026-09-23) charged 5 of 7
  windows. One failure was a held chain drawn 1.5s after its scan: the pile
  had moved, and it linked 7 of 19. The other was a cancel tapped on a tsum
  the band pass took for a bubble. The real bubble sat beside it, and the
  36-chain popped slowly through the close. A wait over `replanAfterWaitMs`
  now rescans, and an unconfirmed cancel taps whatever a fresh read finds
  (`freshTaps`). The refill gate after an uncancelled pass now also waits
  out the extra chains' pops (`popMs`).
- **Gaston's no-bubble hold is judged against the earliest close, and a read
  route keeps his tsums along the top.** `gaston_102.mp4` (2026-09-23)
  charged 6 of 7 windows. The skill closes at tap+9.65s (the antler backdrop
  went at 9.60-9.72 in all seven); `closesAt` puts it 1.0-1.65s later. The
  one miss was a 29-chain with no bubble, judged to pop out before that late
  close: it went unheld and refilled with leftovers. Both holds now use
  `refillBy` (tap + `openMinMs` + duration). The HUD band also cut the
  Gastons joining a pile's halves (6 planned of 14 painted); painted circles
  are now cut only above `paintedHudBand`, 8% more planned over 153 passes.
- **Gaston's drags wait out a fever starting or ending.** Checked on video,
  `gaston_102`-`104.mp4` broke most chains short, about a third of them at a
  fever's start or end, which the antlers hide from the chrome probe. The ring
  round the fever gauge shows both: a drag now waits `feverStartMs` past it
  lighting, and for it to go dark when the fill says the fever ends inside
  the drag (`dodgeFever`, `feverWaitMs` on the pass record). Off by default:
  `gaston_105.mp4` broke as many chains with it on, and its waits cost time.
- **Gaston keeps a bubble for the next cancel.** `gaston_107.mp4` spent 2 and
  3 bubbles cancelling chains of 4 and 5; two held chains then had none and
  the next window's 29-chain went out uncancelled. A chain under
  `cancelMinChain` now spends no bubble, and a cancel leaves one standing
  (`bubbleReserve` 1; `spared` on the pass record).
- **Gaston's drag dwells 30ms a tsum (was 10).** On BlueStacks, `gaston_102`-
  `103.mp4` at 10ms linked 17 of 41 chains whole; `gaston_104`-`108.mp4` at 30
  linked 44 of 75 (73-87% of planned tsums against 57-67%).
- **Gaston's drag picks a stalled chain back up.** About 1.8% of hops fail
  at random, breaking ~40% of thirty-chains. Every 4 tsums and at the end, a
  capture looks for the game's gold coin on the tsums behind the finger; with
  none on four, the finger walks the route back to the last coin (the undo
  unwinds the chain to there) and draws on (`rewind`, `rewinds` and `coins` on
  the pass record). A stall that comes back at the same place is the route's
  (`gaston_111.mp4`: three of four redraws stalled where the first had), so it
  is planned afresh from the chain's end without the failing tsum, or the drag
  stops there; no walk back runs into the close.
- **Gaston's closing chain goes out at once and lets go as the antlers leave.**
  The switch wait held it 0.8-2.6s past the close on `gaston_108`/`109.mp4`,
  and the hold ran to `closesAt`, 1.0-1.6s late. The antlers stay up 8.4-8.6s,
  so the close is timed off them (`antlerMs`); the chain is cut to end
  `closeLeadMs` before it (drags over the close broke 5 of 7), held, and let go
  `antlerReleaseMs` after the antlers leave the chrome. `dodgeSwitch` is off.
- **Gaston's coin check no longer throws mid-drag, and a throw lifts the finger.**
  It called `getImageWidth`, which `globals.d.ts` declared but the host does
  not have: every drag of 12+ threw with the finger down (`gaston_110.mp4`),
  and five in a row restarted the app. `globals.d.ts` now declares only what
  the host registers (12 phantom natives dropped), and `gastonLinkChain` lifts
  the finger on any throw.
- **Gaston's play-loop rules start at his first activation.** `chainLimits`
  (one uncapped chain a scan), `extraClusterSlots` and `readsChainCounter`
  (a counter read per chain) held from the round's start,
  so the loop chained almost only Gaston before the skill had ever fired, and
  `gaston_112.mp4` redrew the same three short chains for 15s. All three now
  follow `gastonActivated`; `SkillHandler` takes a function for the last two.
- **Gaston's windows spend spare bubbles.** An uncharged window hands the
  board to the play loop, which keeps its bubbles for the windows; the windows
  spared every chain under `cancelMinChain` and never popped on a pass with
  no chain, so `gaston_113.mp4` had ten along the bottom by the fourth window,
  refills with no room and 29 of 44 passes drawing nothing. From
  `surplusBubbles` (3) every release is cancelled, and a pass with no chain
  pops all but the reserve (`popped` on `skill.gaston.done`).
- **Gaston's windows clear the other tsums off a crowded board.** Other
  colours' chains went out only after a Gaston chain under 15, four at most
  inside 600ms, and never on a pass with no Gaston chain -- 26 of those in
  `gaston_113.mp4` lifted the finger on boards of 20-odd leftovers. Now a
  board with `mixedFrom` (15) leftovers gets them too, every chain that fits
  in `mixedChainMs` (1000) top of the pile first, and a pass with no Gaston
  chain clears them instead (`gastonClearLeftovers`, `skill.gaston.clear`),
  all while their refill still lands as Gaston. A cancel is judged on the
  whole clear, not the Gaston chain alone.
- **Gaston's window holds its closing chain whenever another would not fit.**
  A chain was held only when it ended inside 800ms of the earliest close, so
  on `gaston_114.mp4` four windows of ten cancelled a second chain that ended
  just short of that and drew a third after the antlers had gone -- released
  0.5-1.8s late, each window 1.5s longer. Now a chain is held when the next
  pass (`nextPassMs`, 1.5s, plus a drag as long) could not end before the
  close. A drag stopped mid-route also reports what it linked, not what was
  planned, so the log, its pop wait and the charge go by that (`gaston_114`
  logged 33, 28 and 23 for drags that had linked about 5, 13 and 9).
- **Gaston's stalled chains walk back to the chain's real end.** Most stalls
  came back on every redraw: on `gaston_114.mp4` a tsum was linked early,
  from one three before its turn, so the chain ended one short of the last
  coin and the next hop was out of that tsum's reach -- the walk back to the
  last coin, the redraw and the replan all started from the wrong tsum. The
  walk back now goes to the tsum before the last coin, the end in either
  case, and plans a fresh route from there clear of what is linked. A stopped
  drag logs its whole route again.
- **Gaston's refill gate starts at the release.** Its floor ran from after the
  cancel's check, adding that check to every pass; it now runs `fillMinMs`
  (800) from the release, and the full, still count decides the rest. The
  hold judges the next pass on the round's measured refill cycle, and each
  pass logs its timings (`headMs`, `releaseMs`, `prepMs`, `cycleMs`): on
  `gaston_116.mp4` a cancel's refill landed 0.95s after the release and the
  next grab came 0.65s after that.
- **Gaston's window plays two cancel rounds, then the closing chain as the
  skill ends.** Holding the second chain whenever a third as long would not
  fit made every window on `gaston_116.mp4` one cancel and a hold idle a
  second into the close. Now both cancelled chains are cut to an even share
  of the time to the last cancel, timed so its refill lands as the antlers
  go (the round's measured refill cycle), and the closing chain is drawn the
  moment they leave -- the game links right after the close, only not across
  it -- cut to `closeChainMax` (20) and released at once, about 0.9s later.
  A closing chain that fits before the close is still drawn and held.
- **Gaston's closing chain is long enough to fill the gauge again.** Only
  its clear fills the gauge, and the 20 cap of the entry above left it short:
  on `gaston_117.mp4` every charge waited ~2s on the chain's own pop, the
  gauge stayed empty through the next window, and five of sixteen never
  filled, where the 23-35 of `gaston_116.mp4` filled it before the next
  window's first chain. `closeChainMax` is 28 (release ~1.2s after the
  antlers), and a closing chain begun before the close stands still through
  it and finishes after (`pausedMs`).
- **Gaston's closing chain reads the paint when it starts past the close.**
  The read was off from `paintBlackoutMs` before the close, so a closing
  chain begun once the antlers had gone was planned off the colour cluster:
  on `gaston_118.mp4` one linked 1 and others broke at 16-24 of 28, charging
  the gauge in 1.3-2.1s instead of at once. Past the close a touched Gaston
  paints the rest as it does inside the window, so that chain reads again,
  and a stall in it can replan.
- **Gaston keeps one bubble from cancel to cancel.** A cancel tapped only
  the bubbles its own read found, remembered ones only when those did not
  take, and a short chain spared them all until three were up: passes on
  `gaston_119.mp4` saw four to seven, each cutting the routes round it. Now
  every cancel taps every known bubble but one -- kept out toward the rim,
  where it cuts the fewest routes -- and from two up (`surplusBubbles`) a
  short chain is cancelled too.
- **Gaston finds the bubbles the Hough misses at the bottom rim.** Lit by the
  rim, they went unread, the tsum scan took them for tsums -- the paint read
  for Gastons, the one behind showing through -- and routes ran into them
  and popped the chain there (two of four late boards on `gaston_120.mp4`),
  while the cancels left them standing. A scanned circle in the bottom band
  whose coin grid reads `bubbleGold` gold (their icons) is now a bubble:
  planned round, and tapped. A chain with no bubble to cancel it is judged
  on every known bubble, remembered ones included, since the cancel taps
  those too now.
- **A Gaston closing chain that stops short is followed by another.** Only
  the closing chain charges the gauge, and one that stalled and stopped at 9
  or 8 (two of ten windows on `gaston_121.mp4`) left the window uncharged
  and the play loop to fill it. While the closing chains total under
  `gaugeChain` (24), another is drawn once the last one's pop has landed --
  every clear past the close fills the gauge -- up to `closeRetries` (2).
  The gauge is tapped through the short chain's pop first and the retry
  goes out only if it did not fill: on `gaston_122.mp4` a 23 was retried,
  the retry found nothing, and the spam's budget had run out behind it, so a
  gauge that may have been full was never tapped (`chargeMinMs`).
- **Gaston's cancel after a long chain keeps no bubble back.** The chain
  earns one as it clears, and that one is the next cancel's; keeping the
  reserve as well left two to four on every board of `gaston_122.mp4`. A
  chain under `bubbleEarnChain` (12) still keeps one.
- **Gaston's stall recovery keeps to the pass's slot and the chain's head.**
  On `gaston_123.mp4` rewinds ran three cancelled passes 0.4-1.6s past their
  slots, and each of those windows lost its second cancel; a redraw is now
  cut to what still fits, as the first draw is. A stall in the first four
  tsums found no coin (they carry dots), walked back to the head, redrew the
  same stall and stopped at 1 -- 1 drag in 10-20. The last coin is now looked
  for from the second tsum (`coinBackFrom`), and a repeat stall at the head
  replans clear of the route's second tsum.
- **Gaston's windows play to the end of the round.** A pass ended its window
  whenever the screen did not read as the game, which the last five seconds'
  flashing border does not: the last windows of `gaston_123`/`124.mp4` quit
  under it and the play loop drew short chains of any colour to the end.
  Only a round-over page ends a window now, as in the play loop.
- **The chain counter reads every colour the game draws it in.** Navy is only
  1-9; past that it is crimson on a pink plate, slate, brown with the digits
  touching, and rainbow from 30, so Gaston's counts -- mostly past 10 when
  read -- registered on 15% of drags. Each colour is its own mask now
  (`styles`), touching digits are split, and the plate may be pink: 67% of
  `gaston_124.mp4`'s drag frames read, 2 to 40. Gaston's rewinds log the count
  at each (`stallCounts`).
- **Gaston's last cancel keeps a recovered chain.** Cut to its slot after a
  rewind, `gaston_124.mp4`'s recovered chains went out at 10 and 13 of 45;
  the last cancelled pass's redraw may now run `rewindGraceMs` (500) past it.
- **Gaston's stall check believes the game's count over the coins.** On
  `gaston_125.mp4` a chain the game counted at 24 was walked back to route 12
  on a coin read that missed. A coin stall is now overruled when the count is
  within `countSlack` (3) of the finger (`countKept`), and a count past the
  last coin moves the walk back up to it, keeping what is linked.
- **The chain counter is quick again.** Its colour masks box ~7 digit-sized
  shapes each on a Gaston board, and the full plate read of every one took a
  read to 76ms (341 at worst); 16 plate points per box, in one read, drop
  most of them first (`plateProbeFrac`). A read along a route now looks only
  round its last `nearTail` (12) tsums, where the counter is.
- **Gaston's cancelled chains go out at a stall instead of being redrawn.**
  Over `gaston_124`-`126.mp4` a cancelled pass's rewinds won a median 5 tsums
  for 610ms -- time the next pass draws ~20 in -- and the trims that followed
  were most of `gaston_126.mp4`'s cut-off chains. A cancelled chain releases
  at a stall once `stopFrom` (8) are linked, or after one redraw below that.
  A closing chain stops when the game's count has not moved since the last
  stall (the board sat pale for 3s after a close the fever ended at), and the
  retry now judges the gauge on the game's count, not the route drawn
  (`gaston_126.mp4`: 42 drawn, 6 linked, no retry).
- **Gaston's window opens no earlier than 4.6s.** The skill's own drop and
  the last closing chain's pop both play out after the animation, so a count
  full at ~3.8s was a board about to clear: those windows drew 0-14 on their
  first pass (dead heads, short routes, a fever starting). Over 637 windows
  to `gaston_129.mp4`, gates that left before 4.6s drew a median first chain
  of 6-11, those from 4.8s on 23-24. The gate's floor is now `openFloorMs`.
- **Gaston's cancelled chains let go at their last tsum.** Each waited
  ~170-200ms there -- the end coin check's 80ms settle, then the count's
  60ms settle and read -- for a stall it would release as it stood anyway
  and a count only the log used: ~6 tsums of every cancelled slot, which now
  goes to the chain. Held chains keep both reads; a released one logs no
  `coins` or `registered`.
- **Gaston's routes plan no hop over 1.6 tsum widths** (`hopReach`, was the
  play loop's 1.9). Over `gaston_121`-`128.mp4` hops of 1.6-1.9 widths were 7%
  of those drawn and 39% of the stalls, at 5-8 times the rate of the rest;
  replayed over 774 logged boards the cap costs 1.7 tsums of plan, mostly
  past what the slots draw.
- **Gaston's cancelled chains run to the end of their slot.** They were cut
  before the drag off a 26ms-a-hop estimate; hops take ~22ms, and on
  `gaston_129.mp4` every trimmed chain let go 120-170ms early, ~6 tsums. A
  cancelled chain now lets go at the hop that would pass its slot's end,
  timed off its own hops; the closing chain keeps the cut up front. One the
  whole route would be held for (no bubble left) is not cut: it ends the
  window anyway (`gaston_132.mp4` held two cut to 32 and 36 of 41 and 42).
- **Gaston reads bubbles better.** Over 108 bubbles marked by hand on
  `gaston_138`/`141.mp4` the reads found 65 and took 11 other circles for
  bubbles -- a Gaston or a Stitch at the rim once took a cancel's taps while
  the real bubble went untapped (`gaston_138.mp4`). Both Hough passes now run
  lower (`hardParam2` 24, `bandParam2` 14, `bandMaxRadius` 20) and every
  circle must look like a bubble inside: no dark hair showing through, not
  white (`bubbleDarkMax`, `bubbleWhiteMax`). The same frames: 85 found, 13
  others, several of those real bubbles the marking missed.
- **Gaston's first window of a round clears the other tsums.** It starts on
  an ordinary board, half of it other tsums packed at the bottom, and only
  what the window clears comes back Gaston. On `gaston_140.mp4` the bottom
  half never cleared, the closing chain found 20 Gastons and drew 16, and the
  charge never came; 4 of 25 first windows to then failed to charge. A
  window the play loop opened now follows each cancelled pass's Gaston chain
  with other-colour chains for up to `convertChainMs` (1.5s), past the pass's
  slot, while the refill still lands before the close (`convert`). The
  scan's colour groups found almost none on `gaston_141`/`142.mp4` (0 and one
  5-chain), so the time left goes to the paint read: a finger on the densest
  leftover paints its kind, and the chain is planned over those, up to
  `convertReads` (3) kinds a pass (`gastonPaintedLeftovers`).
  Its charge spams the whole `gaugeWaitMs`: the gauge starts empty there,
  and `gaston_145.mp4`'s first window stopped at 3.7s with it 0.3s from full.
- **Gaston's last cancel redraws a stall while its slot has room**
  (`lastRewindRoomMs`). A cancelled chain releases at a stall once 8 are
  linked; for the last cancel the time it frees only waits for the antlers,
  and `gaston_138`/`139.mp4` let five go at 13-18 with 0.2-0.9s unused.
  The first cancel does the same with 400ms of its own slot left
  (`firstRewindRoomMs`): 7 of 19 let go at 8-15 with 0.4-0.7s to spare.
- **Gaston's chains stuck at the head start over from the other end.** A
  tsum the game links off the route beside the head leaves the chain stuck
  at 1-3; walking back cannot undo it, and redrawing the same route stalled
  the same way -- 55 of 80 such stalls to `gaston_136.mp4` ended the drag at
  1, most of them the window's first cancel. The finger now comes up and
  goes down on the route's far end (`restartBelow`, `restartSkip`), judged
  on the coins where the count reads lower. The first check stays at the
  twelfth tsum (`checkMinSpan`): moved to the eighth, it read the first
  links' late coins as a stall and walked chains of 9-10 back.
- **Gaston's passes pass over a lookalike.** A game box can hold a second
  dark-haired tsum that clusters with Gaston by colour, and a finger on one
  paints only its own kind: `gaston_134.mp4`'s heads painted 6-17 of 23-30,
  the route ran over the lookalikes, the read then took the real Gastons for
  leftovers, and the whole round drew 3-17 first chains. A head that paints
  under `strayPaint` (12) and under half its cluster is lifted, and the next
  start is tried clear of everything it painted (`stray`).
- **Gaston's last cancel lets go 120ms later** (`closeSlackMs`). Over
  `gaston_130`-`133.mp4` the closing pass was through its refill gate a
  median 113ms before the antlers left and waited 162ms for them; that time
  now goes to the two cancelled chains, whose medians sat at 30 and 31.
- **Three native-image throw windows closed.** The host keeps every capture
  until `releaseImage`, so a native throwing between a capture and its guard
  leaked a frame for the rest of the run: `buildBoardGray` and `tiaraCapture`
  now release on a throw before the return, and `scanBoardQuick`'s overload
  tap moved inside its `try`. Nothing leaked on a normal path.

## [2.1b2]

### Summary

- The script no longer sits on the game's pause menu flipping the Gyro switch when a chore starts during a round; the chore waits for the round instead.
- Max round duration: once it stops playing a long round it now waits for the game over screen however long that takes, instead of picking the round back up after a few minutes.

### Fixed

- **A capped round is left alone until it ends.** Coasting gave up after three
  minutes and handed the task back, and the next pass found the board still up,
  restamped the clock and played on -- so a round the cap had stopped was played
  again in stretches for hours. The give-up is gone: a coast ends only on game
  over or a stop, and `play.roundCoasting` (`ranMs`, `coastedMs`) goes out once
  a minute so a long one is visibly alive. `play.roundCoastGaveUp` is retired.

- **The pause menu's Gyro toggle is no longer tapped once a second.**
  `Page.GamePause.back` sat on the Gyro switch (318,1078), and `PageRoutes`
  declared it an exit, so a `navigate` with any goal but the board -- the
  mailbox or heart chore starting while a round was up, which only stood aside
  for the pause menu -- pressed Pause and then toggled the gyro every pass until
  the stall guard restarted the game (`gyro_stuck.mp4`). The pause menu now
  declares no exit (its other buttons forfeit the round), `back` names To Home
  Screen, and every chore stands aside for a round in progress through
  `roundInProgress` (`src/pages.ts`), logged as `task.stoodAside`.

## [2.0]

### Summary

- Version bump from 1.0 to 2.0
- "Auto Unlock MyTsum Level" setting added: when the level-up screen after a round shows "Raise level cap!" on your MyTsum, the script buys that one raise from the Tsum list and plays on.
- "Hold bubbles last fever seconds" setting added: leaves bubbles alone while a fever is about to end, so they are there to pop into the first chains after it and start the next fever sooner.
- Bubbles are popped once tsums have refilled around them, so one a burst skill leaves is no longer spent on the empty space it left.
- Skip Ruby now works like Skip Medals: rubies are left in the mailbox and the mail under them is still taken, instead of the chore stopping at the first ruby.
- Skip Medals / Skip Ruby no longer open the last mail on a scrolled screen, which on a full medal box left the chore opening the same medal over and over.
- Box Buying no longer stalls on the "You got a Patch!" popup a purchase can come with: it is closed like the reveal card and the sweep goes on.
- Box Buying handles the store refusing a 10-Time purchase on a nearly empty box ("You can't use 10-Time Purchases"): the sweep ends there instead of retrying into it, and the new "Ten, then one until sold out" size carries on singly to empty the box. "Buy ten at a time" became the "Boxes per purchase" dropdown.
- Auto launch finds the Japan game on its own: whichever build is installed is the one started, so nothing has to be set for it. The stats CSV gains a `build` column.
- The selected tsum is named as the running game prints it: in English on the international game, in Japanese on the Japan game.
- The JP game's Magical Time offer is now recognised and cancelled like the EN one.
- Debug tab: a Detect MyTsum button reads which tsum the pre-round screen shows selected, without playing a round.
- Rounds turn over faster: the score tally's count-up is tapped through instead of waited out.
- Round stats: a medal count with a 0 in it is no longer left blank.

### Added

- **`SettingKey.AutoUnlockMyTsumLevel`** (Chores tab, Beta). `record.myTsumLevelCap`
  reads the level-up panel's first card off `LevelUpMyTsumCard` (`src/data.ts`):
  the card is found by scanning the gutter column for panel blue -- the stack
  is still bouncing into place on the frame the router first names, and a
  fixed row read the "Lv" text as the padlock -- and the padlock's white body
  read at its middle. `raiseMyTsumLevelCapIfPending` (`src/levelCap.ts`) runs
  from the play task's tail: to the collection, the greyed "MyTsum Set" button
  proves the panel shows the MyTsum, then the sweep's own raise
  (`raiseSelectedLevelCap`, split out of `raiseCardLevelCap`). A failed raise
  holds the next attempt off for 30 minutes. Live (`LiveWhen.Now`). Proven
  on 14 level-up and 3 collection frames through the bundle; not yet on a
  device -- `unlock.myTsum.*` is what to read.
- **`SettingKey.HoldBubblesLastFeverSec`.** A hold over every Bubble Strategy
  rather than a fourth entry: `bubbleTapBudget` answers 0 while
  `bubblesHeldForFever` (`src/board.ts`) holds, and the All ASAP blind sweep
  stands down too; the strategy resumes when `gFever` calls the fever over.
  Live (`LiveWhen.Now`), shared, a stats column, and a Run order chip.
  `bubble.held` logs each refused pop with the fever's remaining ms.
- **`Tsum.feverRemainingMs` (`src/fever.ts`), `FeverBar` (`src/data.ts`).**
  How long a fever has left, off a ~2.4ms crop of the bar's fill taken per
  pop, the way `checkSkillReadinessFast` reads the gauge -- twenty samples at
  y=1670, lit above a value of 150, each worth 500ms. Read at the moment it
  is asked rather than estimated from the watcher's last look, so a fever the
  game has paused under a skill animation reads as paused. Gated on
  `gFever.active`, because an ordinary full gauge is just as bright. Measured
  on the six corpus fever frames.
- **`Tsum.gameBuild` (`src/appLifecycle.ts`), `GameBuild` (`src/globals.d.ts`).**
  Which build this device plays: the one in front (`focusedGameBuild`, off the
  same `dumpsys window` line `isAppOn` reads, now shared as `focusedPackage`),
  else the one last seen in front, else the one installed (`installedGameBuilds`,
  one `pm path` per package, at most once a run). Both or neither installed
  answers global. `app.build` logs the installed-package read.
- **`BoxTenTimeRefused` (`src/data.ts`).** The "You can't use 10-Time
  Purchases" toast, `targeted` like `LevelCapRaised` because it is the
  `HeartSent` sprite -- a sweep over it answers `HeartSent` -- with one probe
  in the gap between its two lines of wording that refuses both twins.
  Authored on two frames cut from `no_more_10box.mp4`. `Tsum.awaitBoxDialog`
  (`src/boxes.ts`) watches for it beside the purchase confirmation after a
  10-Time press, taps it away, and `buyOneBox` reports `tenRefused`.
- **`BoxPurchaseSize` and `SettingKey.BuyBoxSize` (`src/shared.d.ts`).** One,
  Ten, or TenThenOne, replacing the `buyBoxTenTimes` switch; `loadSettings`
  carries a stored `true` over to Ten once. `buyBoxes` reads it into the
  `tenTimes` it already ran on, which the refusal clears under TenThenOne.
  `Log.Box.TenRefused` records the refusal; `Log.Box.End` reports
  `10-time refused` when it ended the sweep.
- **`BoxPatchPurchasedPage` (`src/data.ts`).** The "You got a Patch!" popup,
  a `patch` configuration of `BoxPurchasedPage`, so `clearBoxReveals` taps
  its Close. The reveal card's entries missed it on the two probes that read
  that card's lit backdrop, which is near-black here; the loop then tapped
  its blind advance point for the whole reveal budget. Authored on a frame
  cut from `premium_plus_badge.mp4`.
- **`MagicalTimeJp` (`src/data.ts`).** The JP build draws the dialog at the
  pre-2025 position with three footnote lines under the buttons; the pre-2025
  entry missed it on its Cancel probe, which reads the wider キャンセル glyphs.
  Probes on the flat button ends either side of the text, and a foot probe
  below where the EN panel ends so the two entries stay apart.

### Changed

- **Skip Ruby** (`receiveHeartsSkipRuby`) goes through the row walk Skip Medals
  built: `mailRowToOpen` reads every found row at each badge its switch turned
  on, opens the first row carrying none, and answers `MailAllSkipped` (was
  `MailAllMedals`) when the screenful is all skipped mail, which scrolls on. The
  fixed ruby probe and the idle-out it forced are gone from the loop.
  `gifts.receiveOne.skipRuby` marks each row stepped past;
  `gifts.receiveOne.medalsOnly` is `gifts.receiveOne.skippedOnly`.
- **The Bubble Strategy pops only bubbles worth popping.** `findGameBubbles`
  counts each bubble's `near` -- the scan's tsum circles within
  `GameBubbleConfig.blastReach` past its edge -- and `popGameBubbles`' default
  path takes only those at `minTsumsInBlast` or more, richest first
  (`ripeGameBubbles`, `src/board.ts`), leaving the rest for the next scan. A
  Burst activation is a blind tap that never arms `settleScansAfterSkill`, so
  the bubble it left was tapped in the hole it sat in. Bounded by
  `unripeHoldScans` (`bubbleUnripeScans`, counted per scan) so a misread cannot
  park one; a skill's explicit limit still takes every bubble. `bubble.unripe`
  logs a refused pop, and `bubble.found` / `bubble.popped` carry `near` / `held`.
- **`src/tsums.dat` is `v2`: a name column per build.** English and Japanese
  side by side, blank where that build's pack has no strip (84 Japanese-only,
  38 with neither). `myTsumLoadLibrary` refuses a v1 file; `selectedTsum` names
  the match by the build in front, falling back to the other column, then the
  id. `tsums.identified` / `tsums.detected` carry `build`.
- **`detectMyTsum` (`src/roundStats.ts`).** The Debug tab's Detect button,
  reached by name through `runScriptCallback` like `reportIssue`. Refuses a
  live run (the loop reads the same screen itself), else builds a throwaway
  `Tsum` on the page's settings for the geometry, sleeps
  `DetectMyTsumSettleMs` for the closed panel to leave the frame -- the host
  captures every window -- and answers the `MyTsumSelection` or a
  `DetectMyTsumRefusal` (`src/shared.d.ts`) as JSON. `tsums.detected` is its
  own event so a log reader cannot take a press for a round's read; the
  banner carries the name with score and margin.
- **`askDetectMyTsum` / `onMyTsumDetected` (`src/settings.ts`).** Closes the
  panel the way the Now buttons do, sends the form, and words the answer under
  the row (`tpl-detect`) in the page's language, so it is there when the
  panel is reopened.
- **`skillWaitOutEndingFever` reads its fill geometry off `FeverBar`** instead
  of its own 345/733 constants; the measured fill runs 350-705, so the
  "nearly over" mark moves by a few px.
- **`waitForScorePage` taps the tally through its count-up
  (`src/roundStats.ts`).** A tap skips the animation and the game draws the
  final figures with the button row at once; the tap is retried every
  `StatsSkipTapMs` while the row is missing, at the spot the overlay tap already
  uses (`StatsBlindTapSpot`, was `StatsUnknownTapSpot`), which is inert on the
  finished tally and on every panel that can drop over it. Only on a look that
  named the tally, so a panel in front is still cleared by its own handler
  first. `stats.tallySkipped` records the taps and how long the row took.

### Removed

- **`SettingKey.JpVersion`.** Its row had been commented out since the public
  release, so `startApp` always launched the international package and a
  Japan-only device never came up. Launch, the force-stops, `selectedTsum`, the
  stats CSV (`build` column, in place of `jpVersion`), the report manifest
  (`script.build`) and the corpus sidecar (`build`; `load.js` still reads
  `isJP` off old ones) all take `gameBuild()` instead. `Tsum`'s constructor
  loses its first argument.

### Fixed

- **A fever is recognised on the 2025 layout.** `FeverProbes`' two
  dimmed-chrome pixels sat under the gauge, and on MuMu that build ends the
  game in a black band there, so `isFeverTime` was false on every frame and
  `gFever` never went active on that device -- the new bubble hold could not
  engage, and the "No skill last fever seconds" hold-off, whose own backdrop
  probe at (340,310) lands on that layout's gem icon, had never fired either.
  Both now read the chrome beside the score capsule, where
  `LevelUpDimmedChrome` reads; the ring thresholds go to 100 for the same
  frames. Measured on three of the device's own trail frames, filed in the
  corpus as `mumu-360x640-fever*`.
- **`renderPage` now drops `reportPanel` with the other panels.** A language
  change re-renders `#tabPanels`, and the Report row's panel was the one still
  pointing at the detached copy.
- **A scrolled mail list no longer opens the row under the Claim All bar.**
  `MailList.scroll` lands the rows half a pitch out of phase, where the last
  row's Check button is whole but its badge is under the bar -- so the medal
  probe read the bar's cyan, the row went as a heart, and with the medal box
  full the pass tapped the same medal over and over (a JP recording).
  `mailRowToOpen` now leaves a row whose deepest probe falls past
  `MailList.buttonColumn.toY` for the next scroll (`gifts.receiveOne.rowUnderBar`).
  `toY` is 1340, the last list pixel: at 1345 the scan's last sample sat on
  the bar, so a button it cut never registered as clipped. Reproduced offline
  by shifting the medals corpus frame.
- **A medal count with a `0` in it reads.** The tally's medals row draws its
  glyphs 19px tall on the 540 emulator where the coin row's are 20, and at that
  height the `0` led `9` by 0.029 -- a thousandth under `StatsMinGlyphMargin`
  -- so 401, 380 and 400 all went to the CSV blank. `StatsDigits` recut with
  two of those tallies in the sample; the worst lead over the corpus is 0.036.

## [1.0]

### Summary

- Version bump from 0.13 to 1.0

### Changed

- **Log sentences shortened.** Every `message` is written to the log file
  verbatim and the `event` id already names what happened, so the English and
  zh-TW catalogues now carry short phrases; the explanations moved out of the
  log line.
