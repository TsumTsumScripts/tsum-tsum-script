// dispatches each eval on its own pool thread, and the engine hands the
// interpreter lock over at every `sleep()` -- and the two have to agree on who
// owns `ts`, the task set and the router.
//
// They did not, and opening the settings page mid-run is what it cost: that
// page's `OnSettingClick` used to evaluate `stop();` -- it no longer does, the
// host pauses instead and Play with the panel open is what sends the `start()`
// that replaces the run -- which cleared `ts` and detached `gPages` while the
// loop was still inside a task. The task's next detect threw
// "PageRouter is not attached", and when the loop finally handed back, `start()`
// finished on `log(ts.logs.TaskControllerStop)` (now `logInfo(Log.Task.LoopStopped)`) with
// `TypeError: cannot read property 'logs' of undefined`. Pressing Play then
// built a second world on top of the first, which is why the script had to be

 * through `JavaScriptInterface.runScript`. It behaves as `unlockLevelsNow` does
 * -- queued on a live run rather than run on the host's thread, or a run started
 * for it when nothing is playing -- and that function carries the reasoning for
 * both.
 *
 * One difference: this sweep has settings of its own -- which box, how many at a
 * time, how many purchases -- so on a live run the form goes onto the run before
 * the sweep is queued. The panel's own save carries them too, but it is pushed
 * on the host's worker thread while this call comes down the bridge, so it need
 * not have landed yet; the sweep would then run on the value the run started
 * with.
 *
 * Returns what it decided, which the host writes to the log.
