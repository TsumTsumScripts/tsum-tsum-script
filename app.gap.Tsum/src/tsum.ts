// The Tsum object itself: the world one run is played in, and the wrappers
// every other file reaches the device through.
//
// What is left here is what nothing else can be written without -- the fields,
// the screen geometry `init` works out, the capture and touch wrappers, and the
// two conversions between the coordinates the tables are written in and the
// pixels the host wants. This file used to be all of it; the work now lives in
// the eight it was split into, which reopen this prototype:
//
//   src/waits.ts         sleep, settleScreen, settleBoard, mayContinue
//   src/appLifecycle.ts  is the game in front, and getting it there
//   src/board.ts         reading the board, and drawing chains on it
//   src/play.ts          playing one round, start to game over
//   src/mail.ts          the mailbox chore
//   src/hearts.ts        the send-hearts chore, and the record it keeps
//   src/levelCap.ts      the level-cap sweep
//   src/boxes.ts         the Box Buying chore
//
// Plenty of others reopen it too -- fever.ts, lorcana.ts, dialogs.ts,
// corpus.ts, roundStats.ts, walkthrough.ts, clickAssist.ts and the skills --
// but those were never part of this file. `interface Tsum` in globals.d.ts is
// the whole list, grouped by the file that implements each member.
//
// Every `Tsum.prototype.NAME = function` assignment, here and there, is declared
// in `interface Tsum` (globals.d.ts), which merges with the class below. That is
// what types `this` and the parameters inside one -- they need no annotations of
// their own.
//
// A class rather than a constructor function purely so `new Tsum(...)` has a
// construct signature and `Tsum.prototype` is typed; the field declarations
// below emit nothing at all.
