// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Gaston
//
// While his skill window is open, every tsum that drops is a Gaston. A chain of Gastons cleared
// in the window refills with more Gastons, so the skill is worth as much board as it clears.
//
// ## The round
// Before the first activation the round plays normally. From then on the skill owns the bubbles
// (`claimsBubbles`) and nothing between windows pops one. Each window (`gastonWindow`) is:
//   1. Two cancelled chains (`passesBeforeHold`, `nextPassMs`), each cut to its slot and
//      cancelled with a bubble on release so the refill lands at once.
//   2. A closing chain, cut to end `closeLeadMs` before the close and released `antlerReleaseMs`
//      after it, so its pop charges the gauge. Gastons cleared while the skill runs charge
//      nothing. A chain with no bubble is held too if its pop would refill after `refillBy`.
//   3. The skill button is spammed (`gastonSpamSkill`). The first full read is the next
//      activation, and the next window opens from it (`afterActivate`).
// The close is timed off the antlers in the chrome (`antlerMs`), not the tap. The window opens
// on a full tsum count that has stopped climbing, behind `openFloorMs`.
//
// ## The route
// The longest path over the free Gastons (`gastonChain`), started from its higher end and away
// from leftovers (`gastonOrient`). The game links only from the head, and links whatever a hop
// crosses, so hops may cross no other tsum or bubble (`gastonNeighbors`). HUD digits in the top
// `hudBand` are not tsums (`gastonFreeBoard`). Each hop dwells `dwellMs`.
//
// ## The paint read: which tsums are Gaston
// A finger resting on a Gaston paints every other Gaston pale. The drag reads each circle before
// the grab and after `paintMs`; a rise of `paintRise` marks a Gaston, and the route is planned
// from the head over those (`gastonLinkChain`, `gastonChainFrom`). A head that paints nothing is
// lifted and the next start tried. Nothing is read inside `paintBlackoutMs` of the close.
// Without a read, the pass falls back to the carry (`gastonCarry`: circles last read as not
// Gaston), then to the biggest colour cluster (`gastonGastons`).
//
// ## Bubbles
// The game stops linking at a bubble, so routes keep clear of every bubble known (`bubbleAvoid`):
// the Hough pass, a lower-threshold pass over the bowl's bottom, and the round's memory
// (`gastonBubbles`). A cancel taps all but `bubbleReserve` (`gastonTapBubbles`), skips chains
// under `cancelMinChain`, and is checked off the tsum count (`cancelDrop`).
//
// ## Other rules
// - Nothing here consults the player's chain settings. Between windows `chainLimits` sends one
//   uncapped chain per scan.
// - Stalls are recovered by the coin check (`rewind`): the drag walks back or restarts.
// - A pass with a short Gaston chain or a mostly-leftover board chains other colours too
//   (`mixedFrom`).
