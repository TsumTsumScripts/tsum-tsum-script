// Coronation Day Elsa
//
// The activation does not clear anything. It opens a freeze window -- 5s at
// skill level 1 up to 10s at level 6, `durationMs` -- and while it is open every
// chain linked freezes a band of tsums across the board: the line through the
// chain's first and last tsum, extended to both screen edges, one to two tsums
// thick and thicker when the line slants or the chain zigzags off it. Frozen
// tsums stay where they are (the board does not move inside the window), and
// one tap on any of them sets the whole pile off at once.
//
// ## The goal: as many short chains as the window allows, then one break
//
// A frozen tsum that a *second* band runs through counts double at the break,
// with a coin bonus on top (a player's write-up of the skill, and its
// screenshots: overlapped ice is shaded pink). So the window is a sweep: short
// flat chains, one after another, each on the lowest row still free, so that
// each new band lies just above the last and overlaps it; the pile is broken
// when the window is nearly out; and the bomb the break spawns is popped.
// Bubbles are popped on every look, ice or not: a pop never sets the pile
// off (the user, 2026-09-25), and a bubble left holes the next band. The
// pile itself is left alone -- with one exception: a board frozen out with
// window to spare is broken on the spot and the refill swept again (`refreezeStarvedLooks`), because the sweep freezes a whole board in
// three to four seconds and a 10s window has room for two piles.
//
// The loop is: capture and read which tsums are ice (`elsaLook`); draw the
// flattest chain anchored in the lowest free row (`elsaRowChain`); wait
// `iceFormMs` for its band to form; look again. One capture per chain is what
// makes the ice *read* rather than modelled -- every chain is planned off a
// board whose ice is where the game put it.
//
// The window runs from the end of the activation animation, not the tap:
// on video the background turns light blue at tap + 1.77s and back at tap +
// 12.18s (32 windows), and chains inside that froze. A clock that closed at
// 11.5s handed the last 0.7s to the play loop. So the clock in here starts at
// `t0 + leadInMs`, and the first chain is not drawn before that either -- a
// chain under the animation is ignored.
//
// The window can outlive the round: the break refills the gauge, so windows
// chain back to back and one opened in the round's last seconds runs past the
// timer. A look that finds nothing to chain checks for a round-over screen
// (`elsaRoundOver`, rate-limited), and so does the close; from then on nothing
// is tapped -- the break's grid and its post-burst pops over the score tally
// are what opened the Options menu on `option_menu.mp4`.
//
// ## A chain the game does not link freezes nothing
//
// A chain planned over one row of the board registers as a touch on one tsum:
// a row holds a colour's tsums two apart with another colour between, a hop
// of nearly two tsum widths, which the game does not link. So the plan spans
// `rowSpan` rows and keeps every hop under `maxHops` -- adjacent tsums
// first, and a wider tier only when no row has a chain of those: at least
// one end sits in the anchor row, and the tsums between may step into the
// rows above. Verified linking on `coronation_elsa_6.mp4`.
//
// What has been observed about how much a chain freezes, kept for whoever
// tunes this next: the band grows with the time since the last freeze -- ~3
// tsums a second in, 7-20 at 4-5s, and a first chain 10-12s in with nothing
// frozen before it took most or all of the board (59 in recording 3, 34 in
// 5). Whether that beats a sweep of many small bands with their overlaps is
// NOT measured; a version that drew two scheduled chains for it made one
// chain a window and was worse than the sweep in play.
//
// ## One tap sets the pile off, so nothing may touch ice until the end
//
// Any contact with a frozen tsum spends the entire pile. Two guards:
//
//   - every chain is planned off a capture taken *after* the previous band
//     formed, so the ice it avoids is read, not modelled;
//   - a candidate whose *drag* would pass within `dragClearance` of read ice or
//     a bubble is not drawn (`elsaPathIsClear`): a bubble touched mid-drag pops
//     and ends the chain there, and ice touched mid-drag is the pile gone.
//
// The premature pops this skill has had, kept for the record: it burst after
// every pass (a reflex; now there is one break); a drag landed on ice a model
// called free (the model is gone -- ice is read); the next drag went out
// before the ice had formed (`iceFormMs` now waits for it); a live tsum
// colour read as ice (the `elsaIceAlikes` whitelist); and the ice read too
// dark for the frozen box on a board with dark tsums under it
// (`frozen.valMin` re-measured, see the tuning data).
//
// ## After the break
//
// The break spawns a bomb bubble where the clear count is shown. The break's
// taps take the bubbles its capture read (they survive the break otherwise),
// and the next look pops the bomb aimed, over the shards it reads as ice --
// and leftover ice between windows is kept unless it is pile-sized, because a
// band left standing doubles under the next window's bands (`orderPaths`).
//
// ## Reading the board through the ice
//
// A frozen tsum still detects as a circle. Whether it is ice is read per
// tsum off its own centre colour (`BoardPoint.local`, a light blur that
// keeps the neighbours out) against the `ice` boxes -- the cube dominates
// the centre whatever tsum is under it -- never planned over, kept clear of
// by every drag. The read has a converse hazard: a live tsum can sit inside
// the box (an event board's pale ice-blue fluffy tsum did, and every scan
// read a dozen-tsum phantom pile). The answer is a whitelist read when ice
// is impossible: until the round's first window opens no ice can exist, so
// any colour cluster whose tsums read as ice on those scans is a live
// colour, remembered by its cluster centre for the round (`elsaIceAlikes`),
// and its tsums are never ice. The match is loose on value and tight on hue
// and saturation:
// the same live blue read (102, 88, 185) between windows and (99, 84, 208)
// under the fever tint on `coronation_elsa_3.mp4`, and a plain distance of
// 15 called the second one ice -- which cost every window of that run.
//
// ## Which tsums are one kind: the kind read
//
// Two pale kinds can share a colour cluster -- cream Coronation Elsas and a
// pale-pink tsum both read as skin at the centre -- and a chain mixing them
// never links (22% of one round's chains). The game can tell: with a finger
// on a tsum it darkens every other kind. Once a cluster has produced a dead
// chain this round (`elsaMixed`), its chains go out with the finger resting
// on the plan's lower end first; its members whose floor did not drop are
// the head's kind, and the chain is replanned over those (`elsaKindChain`).
// A first read where nothing darkens clears the cluster again: that chain
// died of a hop, not a kind. Ice reads stay out of it: ice does not darken
// either.
//
// The ice also eats colour slots: the board scan keeps its biggest
// `uniqueTsumCount - 1` clusters and each ice shade takes one, so
// `extraClusterSlots` on the declaration makes room for them -- a tsum in a
// dropped cluster is not in the board array for any look to read. See the
// declaration's comment.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// --- Tuning data ---------------------------------------------------------
//
// ## Reading a frozen tsum
//
// The game draws a translucent ice cube over a frozen tsum (its sprite: a
// pale blue-white hexagon, more opaque at the edges) and white shards around
// it; a tsum under two bands gets a second cube in blue-violet, which lands
// on screen as a pale pink-lavender. On screen the cube dominates the centre
// whatever is under it: frozen centres read hue 88-135, saturation 25-150
// and value 175-255 off a light blur, on every pile replayed from
// `coronation_elsa_8..10.mp4`, and the doubled ones read near-white (s < 25,
// v > 235, hue 90-175 -- what hue a near-white has). Live colours that come
// near: blue and cyan tsums (saturation 175-230, so `satMax` 150), peach and
// pink faces (hue 5-20 or 170+ at low saturation, so the pale box keeps a hue
// range), a black-and-white face whose centre is its white patch (contrast
// 41-58 against 3-30 for ice and shards, so `paleContrastMax`). Shards on
// bare floor read as pale too; they are taken as ice, which costs nothing --
// a drag avoids them and a tap on them does nothing -- where taking them as
// tsums drew chains of them.
//
// That per-tsum read is `ice`, off `BoardPoint.local`. The 22px smear the
// clustering samples is a different thing: it reads a tsum ringed by ice as
// pale itself (four black Mickeys in a glow read as a pile; two faces one
// pink, one peach merged into a chain that never linked), which is why ice
// is not read from the cluster centres any more. The cluster centre has one
// job left: it is the key the ice-alike whitelist remembers a live colour
// by (`elsaIceAlikes`) -- a grey-blue cat on `coronation_elsa_11.mp4` reads
// as ice tsum by tsum, and an event board's pale ice-blue tsum did before
// it; learned before the first window, their clusters are never ice.
