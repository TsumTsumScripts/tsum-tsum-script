// than the old two-check window (~5s) while the game is still running — the
// play loop would bail mid-game and stall on the "unknown" screen. So an
// unrecognized screen alone is not proof of game over; require positive
// confirmation instead: a game that really ends always reaches a known
// out-of-game page (the score tally lands on ScorePage). Poll until the HUD
// comes back (still playing), a known page shows up (game over), or the
// grace window runs out (assume over — the old behavior, just later).
// The screens a round can actually end on.
//
// A round that really finished lands on the score tally, by way of the
// new-record panel, the post-round tsum level-up panel, the account level-up
// panel or the Magical Time offer. Nothing else in the table can follow a
// running round, so nothing else is evidence that one has ended.
//
// This list exists because "any page the table can name" was being treated as
// that evidence, and the table is not uniformly trustworthy. `ClosePage` is a
// deliberate single-pixel catch-all for the standard close button at centre
// bottom -- one positive probe at (540,1588) with threshold 80, which
// `pages:selftest` reports every run under "catch-all risk". Mid-round that
// pixel sits on the fever bar (rgb(8,191,231) on the corpus board frame), and a
// fever payout or a burst skill washing the bottom band yellow moves it to
// something ClosePage accepts. When that happened while the HUD was also
// obscured -- the same instant, since both are the same animation -- ClosePage
// was the only entry left passing, and one frame of it ended the round: the play
// loop broke out mid-game, waitForScorePage spent its fifteen seconds waiting
// for a tally that was never coming, and the round was recorded with no score
// and no coins.
//
// The half of that which has since been fixed is the HUD: `GamePlayingHudProbes`
// (data.ts) was re-measured against six captured fever frames and moves by at
// most 12 there, so the board now fingerprints through a fever and ClosePage is
// no longer the only entry passing on such a frame. What is not fixed is the
// general case -- a burst skill's full-screen animation and the mid-round
// level-up banner have never been captured -- which is why this list, and the
// narrowed sweep below, both stay.
//
// Widening ClosePage's fingerprint is the other half of this and is deliberately
// not done here: it is a navigation catch-all that answers for screens nobody
// has enumerated (events, My Info, settings), so tightening it trades this bug
// for a navigation stall. Not trusting it as proof of game over costs nothing.
//
// The play loop now also refuses to *read* ClosePage mid-round: its liveness
// check scores `inRoundPages()` instead of the whole table, so the entry is not
// a candidate there at all. The narrower question -- which of those pages mean
// the round is over -- is `roundOverPages()`: the tally and the panels before
// it, as each declares in `PageProfiles` (`PageRole.Tally`, `PageRole.PreTally`).
// The event card's screens are among them: the round ends onto its result
// overlay, which has no fingerprint (event art -- see waitForScorePage), and the
// play loop's own trailing taps can have advanced it to the event page already.
// Also the guard for confirmGameOver, which does sweep the whole table.
