// The emitted event vocabulary: every name this script broadcasts, once.
//
// Separate from `Log` (src/logEvents.ts) on purpose. A log line is for a person
// reading a run afterwards; an emitted event is an *interface* another program
// reacts to as the run happens -- an OBS recorder starting on `round.start` and
// stopping on `round.end`. Renaming a log event costs a grep; renaming one of
// these breaks somebody's tooling.
//
// A `const enum` per component inside a namespace that is erased with them, the
// same shape as `Log`: the bundle carries the bare string and nothing else, and
// what it buys is one definition to jump to, find references on and rename.
//
// The host defines none of these names and reads none of the payloads -- see
// `../game-automation-app/docs/EVENTS.md`. What each one carries is EVENTS.md,
// which is generated from the call sites by `npm run events:docs`, so adding an
// event here and emitting it is the whole of the work.
