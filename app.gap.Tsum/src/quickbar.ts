// The engine half of the Quick Bar.
//
// The Quick Bar is the strip the host draws on the screen's bottom edge, under
// the log: the handful of settings worth changing between rounds, without
// opening the settings panel and without ending the run. Its page is
// `src/quickbar.html` and lives in the host's WebView; everything here is what
// that page reaches through `JavaScriptInterface.runScript`.
//
// Three entry points, and they are the whole contract:
//
//   quickBarState()          what to draw -- the live values and the run's coin
//                            averages, as one JSON string
//   quickBarApply(key, ...)  one setting, onto the running world
//   onPause()                the host's pause hook (below)
//
// The first two are read by the settings page as well, which is why the apply
// itself is `quickBarApplyOne`, a function of its own. What a live setting
// change *is* lives here; `applyLiveSettings` (src/index.ts) is the settings
// page's way in to that same switch, so the strip and the panel cannot
// disagree about which rows a run in progress will take.
//
// ## Why the settings are written onto `ts` and not through `start()`
//
// `start({...})` builds a whole new world: a new `Tsum`, a new task set, a new
// run record. That is the right thing when the settings page is closed and
// wrong here -- the point of the Quick Bar is to change something *mid-run*,
// keeping the round, the stats and the coin averages that go with it. So each
// key is written to the field `buildRun` would have written it to, and the page
// separately patches localStorage so the settings page agrees at the next start.
//
// A change is written to `ts.settings` as well, which is why that object means
// "what the world is set to" rather than "what start() was handed". The
// round-stats CSV is written from a copy of it taken when the round began, so
// without that write every row would go on quoting the settings page's values
// hours after the strip had moved on from them.
//
// ## Why most of them wait
//
// The strip is opened over a round that is *paused*, not one that has ended, so
// a setting the round was **set up** under cannot be changed halfway through
// it -- only decided again for the next one. Which tsum is on the board, which
// items were bought, how many colours it was dealt with: written straight onto
// the world they leave the play loop reading a board under rules it was never
// dealt under, which is a round that goes wrong rather than a round that
// changed.
//
// So waiting for the whistle is the **default**, and landing now is the
// exception a setting has to earn by being read fresh, during play, by the pass
// that wants it. `LiveSettings` further down is that decision per setting, with
// the read site named for each `Now`; `quickBarApplyPending` is the whistle;
// and `quickBarAsked` is why the pages still draw the new value at once.
//
// ## onPause
//
// The host evaluates `onPause()` **after** it sets the engine's pause flag, and
// lets that one evaluation through the gate that parks `tap()` for everyone else
// (see the host's `awaitResume`). Pressing the game's own Pause button here is
// what stops the round's clock while the user edits.
//
// After, not before, because the two orders are not equivalent: run before the
// flag, the press lands while the play loop is still going, and the loop's next
// detect sees `GamePause` and has `dismiss.resumeGame` press Continue straight
// back -- the round carries on with the script frozen beside it. Frozen first,
// nothing here is racing anything.
//
// Resuming needs no counterpart: the play loop's next detect sees `GamePause`
// and `dismiss.resumeGame` presses Continue, as it does for any other way in.

// `LiveSettings` below is that answer, declared once per setting. It is not a
// convenience over the switch -- it is what `npm run live:check` compares the
// switch, `quickBarState` and `SHARE_SLOTS` against, so a setting added without
// one of the three is a failing check rather than a bug found on a device weeks
// later. What that check enforces, exactly:
//
//   * every row a preset carries (`SHARE_SLOTS`) is named here;
//   * `Now` and `NextRound` keys have a `case` in `quickBarApplyOne`, and

//     conversion (`skillInterval`, `linkReach`) from oscillating the form;
//   * a `NextRound` key touches nothing but `pendingSettings` until the
//     whistle, and a `Now` key touches the world at once.
//
// What it cannot decide is *which* of the three a new setting is. That is a
