// Ambient declarations for the Game Automation Platform runtime, the shared
// value shapes, and the parts of `Tsum` that are defined outside its
// constructor.
//
// This file emits nothing. It is the first entry in tsconfig.json's `files`, so
// everything declared here is visible to every other file in the bundle.
//
// ## Why `interface Tsum` lives here
//
// `Tsum` is a class in tsum.ts, but every one of its methods is attached as
// `Tsum.prototype.NAME = function ...`, from a dozen files, because the bundle
// has no modules and a class cannot be reopened. Declaring those methods in an
// interface of the same name merges them into the class type, which buys three
// things the plain prototype assignment cannot:
//
//   * `ts.foo()` and `this.foo()` are checked, completed and find-referenced
//     everywhere, instead of being `any`;
//   * each method's `this` and parameters are *contextually typed* from the
//     declaration below, so the assignment sites need no annotations at all;
//   * `Tsum.prototype.typo = ...` is an error, so a method can't be defined
//     under a name nothing calls.
//
// Adding a method therefore means adding its signature here as well. That is
// the cost of the arrangement, and the reason each one carries a real type
// rather than `any`.
