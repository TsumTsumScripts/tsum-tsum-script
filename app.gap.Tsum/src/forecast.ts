// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// What the script is about to do, answered without doing any of it.
//
// Three questions, three layers, and they are three different things:
//
//   DISPATCH  which subscription is about to touch this frame, and what the
//             rest of the queue will get to do about it. `PageRouter.plan` is
//             already the exact ordered queue and is pure, so the only thing
//             missing was which entry ends it -- which is the band's answer
//             (`ForecastActingBands`, below) unless the entry declared a
//             condition (`acts`, globals.d.ts), and the dispatch reads both.
//   TASKS     which job the scheduler runs next, and when the rest come due.
//             `dueTasks` (taskController.ts) is the loop's own pick, reused
//             here rather than re-read, so this orders the set the way the loop
//             really would.
//   ROUTES    the ways off this screen, where each leads, and which of them
//             gets closer to where `navigate()` is going. The edges are
//             `PageRoutes` and `AnchorRoutes` in data.ts.
//
// ## What this is not
//
// It is not a successor filter. Nothing here is consulted by `sweep`, by
// `detect`, or by anything deciding what is on display -- read backwards, these
// edges turn a recognised screen into `Unknown`, which is OBSCURED_BOARD.md
// § The design that was rejected. Forward, a missing edge says "no route", which
// is loud, and that is the only direction used.
//
// It also predicts nothing about the game. "Expected next" here means *what the
// script intends*: the button it is about to press and where the table says that
// leads. Whether the game agrees is what `docs/transitions.json` records, and
// the detection suite's self-test is where the two are compared.
//
// ## Cost
//
// Debug-gated at the top of `forecastEmit`, and the heavy fields are thunks, so
// a run without debug logs pays one boolean per page change. With them on it
// pays one `plan()` -- a sort over ~12 registered subscriptions, no capture and
// no native crossing -- and only when the answer has actually changed, which is
// what `gForecastLast` is for: the play loop's liveness check calls `detect`
// several times a second on the same board, and a record per look would drown
// the file it is meant to explain.
