// Sending hearts.
//
// The flow the game draws, and nothing else:
//
//   FriendPage   tap a pink heart in the right-hand column
//   GiftHeart    OK
//   HeartSent    the "Heart sent!" toast. It waits for a tap rather than
//                clearing itself, and the friend list is still underneath, so
//                one tap both acknowledges the send and puts us back on the list
//
// A row that has had its heart turns dark blue, so the column scan is its own
// progress check: send, rescan, repeat until the screenful has none left, then
// scroll and repeat until a drag stops changing anything. Then Home and back --
// which reopens the ranking at our own row -- and the same sweep upwards.
//
// This replaced an earlier loop that tracked four fixed row positions and read
// four hand-measured pixels to decide it had reached the end of the list. The
// end is now the point where the list will not move, and the rows are wherever
// the pink is.
//
// A slow connection puts a "Loading" spinner over the list, which blocks input
// and can end in a timeout dialog. So a send whose row is still pink is waited
// on, the dialog gets Retry, and a drag that did not move is tried again before
// it counts as the end of the list.
//
// The running total lives at the bottom of this file: `readRecord` /
// `saveRecord` are `hearts.json`, which counts hearts sent from here
// and hearts received in mail.ts.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Measured on a debug run with a screen recording beside it: the game takes
// ~0.4s to open the gift dialog after the heart tap, ~0.45s to close it after
// OK and ~0.8s more before the toast, which goes the frame after its tap. The
// waits below poll for each of those rather than settling after every tap --
// three settles were ~0.6s a heart of watching a screen that had already
