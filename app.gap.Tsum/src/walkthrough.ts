// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Walkthrough recorder: the human drives, the script writes down what happened.
//
// A mode rather than a task. With it on, `buildRun` registers nothing else and
// the recorder never calls `gPages.detect()` -- only `sweep()`, which scores the
// table without broadcasting. That is the whole contract: no subscription fires,
// so nothing taps, so what gets recorded is what the *person* did. A dispatch
// here would have `dismiss.magicalTime` cancelling dialogs out from under them.
//
// What comes out, per visit to a screen:
//
//   which page it was, and which `Page` entry matched
//   how long it was up
//   every tap made while it was up, in screen pixels *and* in the 1080x1920
//   logical space `Button` and `Page` are written in
//   which page followed
//   a frame, subject to the budgets below
//
// Which is the data `docs/transitions.json` is missing: it knows FriendPage
// leads to GiftHeart, and this says it does so when you tap (910, 656). That is
// an anchor, measured -- see BACKLOG.md on routing over declared edges.
//
// Taps are read off the raw Linux input stream by `pollTouchDown` (clickAssist.ts),
// which is why this is possible at all.
