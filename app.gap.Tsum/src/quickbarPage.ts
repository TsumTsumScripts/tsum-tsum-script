// The Quick Bar's page script: wiring only.
//
// Everything about how the strip *looks* is in quickbar.html and quickbar.css,
// and this file never builds a control -- it finds the ones the markup already
// wrote, by their `data-key`, and keeps them in step with the running script.
// That is what makes the layout safe to iterate on: move a cell, add one, drop
// one, and nothing here changes.
//
// ## The two halves of a change
//
// A value edited here is written twice, and both are needed:
//
//   * `quickBarApply()` in the engine puts it on the *running* world, which is
//     the whole point -- the round, the stats and the coin averages survive;
//   * localStorage carries it to the settings page, so the next `start()` does
//     not hand back the value the user just changed. Both pages are file://
//     documents in the same WebView origin, so `StorageKey.Settings` is
//     literally the same entry the settings page reads.
//
// A third write follows once the engine has answered: `broadcast` tells the
// settings page to read the running world again, so the form on screen moves at
// the change rather than on its own poll. The store above is what the *next*
// run starts from; this is what the form is showing now.
//
// ## Why it polls
//
// The coin averages move a round at a time and nothing pushes them, so the page
// asks. It only asks while it is on screen and the run is live -- `onGapState`
// is the host telling it which -- so a hidden strip costs nothing.
//
// A settings change made on the other page arrives sooner than that: it nudges
// this one the same way (`onGapMessage`), and the poll is what covers what no
// nudge does -- the averages, and anything the engine moved by itself.
//
// ## Why a change waits
//
// Both halves of a write are expensive and neither is wanted per tap: the apply
// crosses the bridge and is answered, and the answer pulls a fresh state back
// over it. So a change is drawn immediately, held for `QB_APPLY_DEBOUNCE_MS`,
// and sent once the taps stop -- one round trip for a stepper held down, not
// one per press. The strip never shows the wait, because it draws from the tap
// rather than from the reply.
