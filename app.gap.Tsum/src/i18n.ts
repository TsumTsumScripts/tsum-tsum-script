// The page-side i18n runtime: which language, and the text for a key in it.
//
// Both WebView pages load this -- the settings page and the Quick Bar -- ahead
// of their own script and ahead of the catalogues, which register themselves
// into `gLocales` as they load. Adding a language is therefore additive: write
// one `src/ui<Tag>.ts`, list it in the two page tsconfigs and the two HTML
// files, and it appears in the picker with no other file touched.
//
// ## What a catalogue owes
//
// English (`src/uiEn.ts`) is the reference and is typed `UiStrings`, so it must
// be complete -- a new `UiText` member fails the build until it has English
// text. Every other language is `UiStringsPartial` and falls back to English key
// by key. That is deliberate: forcing a translation to be finished before it
// compiles is what stops languages being added at all, and an English line in a
// mostly-Chinese page is better than a blank one. `npm run i18n:check` reports
// what each language is still missing.
//
// ## Why nothing here is resolved early
//
// Text is looked up at *render* time, never at load time. The language can
// change while the page is up -- the picker redraws rather than reloads, since
// the host delivers this document with no URL of its own to reload -- so a
// string resolved into a data structure at load would be stuck in whatever
// language the page opened in. That is what `i18nThunk` is for.
