// Structured logging.
//
// Every line this script writes is one JSON object on one line -- JSONL, which
// is what Logdy (and every other log viewer worth pointing at an overnight run)
// can filter and column without a custom parser. `LOGGING.md` is the schema and
// the vocabulary; this file is the machinery.
//
// The shape, in the order the keys are written:
//
//   {"timestamp":"2026-08-22T14:30:00.123Z","level":"info","component":"play",
//    "event":"play.gameStart","message":"Game Start","runId":"lz4k9c2","roundId":7,
//    "data":{"chains":63,"hudLostMs":1840}}
//
// **A fixed envelope, and one `data` bag.** Every record has the same top-level
// keys whatever it is about; everything a particular call site had to say lives
// under `data`. That split is worth having for three reasons: the top level is a
// schema you can assert rather than a sentence in a document, a field named
// `level` or `event` can no longer collide with the record's own, and the two
// renderers that turn a record back into a human line need no list of "keys that
// are not payload" to keep in sync.
//
// Four things earn their place on every record:
//
//   `event`     a stable, dotted, language-independent key. This is the field
//               you filter on. It never changes when the wording does, and it
//               is the same string whichever language the run is set to.
//   `message`   the human sentence, in the run's language -- one catalogue per
//               language under `src/logs*.ts`, keyed by the event and merged
//               over English by `logStringsFor`. Absent when an event has no
//               catalogue entry at all.
//   `component` the first segment of the event, so `play.gameStart` is
//               `play`. Free, and it is the coarse filter you reach for first.
//   `runId`     one id per start()..stop(), stamped on everything in between.
//               Overnight runs restart the game app and re-enter tasks all
//               night; without this there is no way to tell one run's lines
//               from the next one's in a rotated file.
//
// `roundId` joins them once a game is in progress -- the inner correlation
// scope, so "show me everything that happened in round 40" is one filter.
//
// Context is injected here rather than at the call sites, which is the only way
// it stays on every line it belongs on instead of the lines somebody remembered
// to add it to. The ids go in the envelope because they are true of any log line
// anywhere; the heart tally goes in `data`, and only on `hearts.*` records,
// because a running total means nothing next to a board scan.
//
// Values keep their types: a count is a number, not a number spliced into a
// sentence. That is the whole reason to do this -- `chainLength > 20` is a
// filter you can type, and `"Chain lengths 21,14,9"` is not.
