// registered them, and the settings page's Run order card (`runOrderSteps`,
// src/settings.ts) listed them -- by hand, with nothing keeping the two in step.
// This file is in **both** compilations (tsconfig.json and tsconfig.settings.json,
// the way src/skillOptions.ts is), so there is one table: the script registers
// what it says, and the page describes what it says.
//
// Names, priorities and intervals only. Which method a name binds to is
// `taskBody` in src/index.ts; what a name is called on the page is
// `runOrderSteps`. Both switch on `TaskName`, so a job added here without a
// body or a label is a build error rather than a silent omission.
