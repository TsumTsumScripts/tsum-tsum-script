 * is a guess at how long a panel takes to arrive, and the game measures that in
 * frames rather than milliseconds -- so the guess is only right on the device it
 * was made on, and it is the slower device it is wrong on, where the next tap
 * lands inside the animation and is swallowed by it (DRIVING_SCREENS.md § 4).
 * Watching the animation instead needs no frame rate to be configured.
 * DRIVING_SCREENS.md § 5 is the rule, and where it must not be used.
 *
 * `maxMs` is a budget, not a duration: this returns the moment the screen holds
 * still, so a generous one costs nothing on a fast device and is what a slow one
 * needs. Poll cost is `ScreenSettle`'s sixty probes off one capture.
 *
 * False means the budget ran out with the screen still moving, or the run
 * stopped. Neither is fatal -- the caller was going to sleep blind anyway -- so
 * only a caller with something better to do than carry on need look.

 * board barely changes between readings and a falling one changes a lot.
 *
 * What it replaces is the flat rest after a skill fires -- the "Skill Waiting
 * time" setting, spent in full whether the clear took one second or three.
 * `maxMs` is that budget now: the call returns once the board has held still
 * for `quietReads` readings, and not before `minMs`, because a skill's cut-in
 * can hold the board motionless before the clear and that is not the stillness
 * wanted. A caller whose clear is already under way may pass a lower `minMs`,
 * and the "Wait for Settle" look *before* an activation passes 0: nothing has
 * fired yet, so there is no cut-in to wait through. What comes off is the tail
 * of the wait, where the tsums have landed and the clock is still running.
 *
 * `onMoving` is called once, the first time a reading shows the tsums moving,
 * for a caller with something to do about a board that is not still yet -- the
 * "Wait for Settle" look pops bubbles there. A board still from the first read
 * never calls it.
