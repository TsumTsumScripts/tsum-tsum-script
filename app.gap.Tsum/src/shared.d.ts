// serialises a settings object into a `start({...})` source string and hands it
// to `JavaScriptInterface.runScript`. Nothing at runtime checks that the object
// the UI builds is the object `start()` expects -- a renamed key is a silently
// ignored setting, not an error.
//
// This file is the one thing both compilations include (tsconfig.json and
// tsconfig.settings.json), so the two sides are checked against the same type.
// Emits nothing.

/**
 * Every playable skill, as the game's own internal ids.
 *
 * This one string travels the whole width of the project: the settings UI
 * offers it in the Skill Type dropdown, it crosses the `start({...})` bridge,
 * the skill files register handlers under it, and the play loop compares
 * against it. Nothing at runtime ties those four together -- a mismatch means
 * `SkillHandlers[skillType]` misses and the skill quietly falls back to
 * "randomize and wait", which plays but never performs the choreography.
 *
 * Declaring the set here makes all four checked against one list. The comment

// so a runtime constant object here would have to be duplicated into each. A
// compile-time-only one does not exist at runtime at all.
