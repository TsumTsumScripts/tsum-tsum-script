# The General Automation Platform service launcher, run ON the device.
#
# This is tools/start-service.sh's algorithm, relocated. Every step of it was
# already an `adb shell` call against this shell, so hosting it here means the
# logic exists once -- the Windows and POSIX front-ends only push this file and
# read its output -- and one launch costs one round trip instead of ten.
#
# Written for Android's mksh/toybox: strict POSIX, no [[ ]], no arrays, no
# bashisms. It must also arrive with LF line endings; a CR makes mksh fail on
# every line (see .gitattributes).
#
# Usage:  sh gap-service.sh <probe|start|stop|log|clean> [--force] [--tcp PORT]
#                                                        [--script ID]
#
# Output is key=value lines plus sentinel-delimited raw blocks. See PROTOCOL.md.
