# Assembles the standalone service-starter bundle.
#
# The bundle carries no adb: the tool downloads Google's platform-tools for
# the computer it is running on the first time it runs, verified against the
# checksums in starter/platform-tools.txt. That file is the pin. This
# script fetches the same three archives (cached in build/platform-tools/) to prove the pin still names real, unchanged bytes,
# and rewrites it with --record-sums when the revision is bumped.
#
# Two archives come out, and the .tar.gz is the one to hand to macOS users:
# tar does not propagate com.apple.quarantine, and Archive Utility does.
#
# --scripts-only leaves out the APKs: the same folder with only the scripts
# in it, a few hundred KB instead of ~40 MB. It is what a user who already has
# the full bundle extracts over it to pick up a starter fix, since an
# extracted bundle has no self-update. On its own it works exactly like the
# full bundle, less the APKs.
#
# --channel-url URL writes channel.txt into the bundle, so it starts pinned to a
# pre-release folder (see docs/PRERELEASE.md) and the tester passes no flag.
#
# The starter's website is served by tsum-stats, which the bundle downloads on
# first run like adb. --stats-pin FILE is that program's pin (default: the
# tsum-stats.txt of the tsum-stats checkout beside this repo, which its own
# release writes); it is copied in as tsum-stats.txt, and must name at least
# MIN_STATS, the first version that serves the starter.
#
# Bundles update their own scripts from the page. starter-version.txt (bump
# its version for every release) is copied in with update_url=<release
# URL>/starter.txt added; a --scripts-only build also writes that starter.txt
# beside the archives -- the version, and the .tar.gz's URL and sha256 -- and
# it is uploaded to the release with them. --release-url changes the base
# (default: this repo's latest GitHub release).
