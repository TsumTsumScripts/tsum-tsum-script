# The numbered menu -- the bundle's only front-end on Windows.
#
# There is deliberately no window any more: a terminal is the one thing every
# machine that can run adb already has, and it is also the log pane. Every
# option here has a command-line twin (gap.ps1 -Action), so nothing is
# reachable only by menu.
#
# Two pages. The device list, and the page of the one device chosen from it,
# where every action runs. That device stays chosen -- across runs too, through
# last-device.txt -- until "d" asks for the list again, so nobody picks the
# same emulator after every action. Each page says what it is for and what to
# do next, because the terminal is all the guidance there is.
#
# gap-device.ps1 and gap-actions.ps1 do the work and word every message the
# same way their POSIX twins do, so nothing is implemented twice here -- this
# file only asks the questions.
