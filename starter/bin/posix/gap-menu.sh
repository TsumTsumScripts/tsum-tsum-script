# There is deliberately no native dialog path any more: a terminal is the one
# thing every machine that can run adb already has, and it is also the log
# pane, which no dialog box can be. Every option here has a command-line twin
# in gap.sh, so nothing is reachable only by menu.
#
# Two pages. The device list, and the page of the one device chosen from it,
# where every action runs. That device stays chosen -- across runs too, through
# last-device.txt -- until "d" asks for the list again, so nobody picks the
# same emulator after every action. Each page says what it is for and what to
# do next, because the terminal is all the guidance there is.
#
# Sourced by gap.sh with gap-device.sh and gap-actions.sh already loaded. This
# file asks questions and prints verdicts; it never talks to adb itself.
