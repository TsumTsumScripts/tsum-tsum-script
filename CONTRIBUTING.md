# Contributing

The contributor guide is part of the Tsum Tsum website, which lives in its own
repository (`tsum-tsum-website`, checked out beside this one) and is published at
https://tsumtsum.gapscripts.app/docs/. It explains the script to someone who has never
seen the code — what it is, how it is put together, how to add a skill, a
setting, a page or a task, and how to ship a build or a script library of your
own. Start there; `CODEMAP.md` is the index into the tree itself.

The short version:

1. Work in `app.gap.Tsum/`: `npm install`, then `npm run typecheck` and
   `npm run build`.
2. Before a pull request, run the gates: `pages:docs:check`,
   `events:docs:check`, `dispatch:eval`, `map:check`, `i18n:check`,
   `live:check`.
3. File the change in `app.gap.Tsum/CHANGELOG.md` under
   `## [<the version in package.json>]` — a `### Summary` line only for what a
   player sees — and give any new file, tool or document its row in
   `CODEMAP.md`.
4. Keep line endings LF (`.gitattributes` pins them; `core.autocrlf` off).
5. This tree is public, and so is the documentation site built from it.
   Nothing in either may name the private maintainers' repository or describe
   what it holds, carry anything of the game's, or copy code from the host app.

Bugs and wanted features are in `app.gap.Tsum/BACKLOG.md`.
