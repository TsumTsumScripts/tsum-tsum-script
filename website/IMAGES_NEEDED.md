# Images the site still needs

Every `<ImagePlaceholder id="..." />` in `docs/` is listed here, and
`npm run refs:check` fails when the two disagree. To replace one: drop the
image in `static/img/<id>.png`, then either add `src="/img/<id>.png"` to the
placeholder (it renders as a captioned figure) or swap it for a plain
`![alt](/img/<id>.png)`, and remove the row here.

Capture at the device's native resolution, in the game's portrait
orientation, with no personal data on screen (friend names, player ids).
