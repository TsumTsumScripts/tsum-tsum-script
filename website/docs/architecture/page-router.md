# Page router

Recognising a screen is half the job; the other half is what happens next.
Both belong to one place. `gPages` (a `PageRouter`, in `pages.ts`) is the only
thing that looks, and it **broadcasts** what it found. Anything that wants to
react registers a subscription in `pageHandlers.ts` rather than writing another
branch of its own.

  record --> guard["guard · 60<br/>not a game screen at all"]
  guard --> dismiss["dismiss · 40<br/>interruptions in the way"]
  dismiss --> navigate["navigate · 20<br/>toward the goal, only inside navigate()"]
  navigate --> notify["notify · 10<br/>logging; runs even after the queue stopped"]
  guard -. "first one to tap ends the queue" .-> notify
  dismiss -. "first one to tap ends the queue" .-> notify
```

## Detection

Every screen the script knows is a **fingerprint** in the `Page` table in
`data.ts`: a handful of probe pixels, each with the colour expected there and a
tolerance. `sweep` scores every entry against a captured frame and takes the
best, weighing evidence before comfort — an entry confirming more probes beats
one that matched more loosely on fewer.

Several `PageName`s have more than one `Page` entry — regional, emulator and
resolution variants of the same screen. That is why the enum is written by hand
rather than derived from the table: the keys are fingerprints, the names are
screens.

A caller that knows what it is watching can pass an `expect` list, which
narrows which entries are scored at all.

## Broadcast

Every detection produces a `PageEvent`: the page, the previous page, whether
the screen actually turned over since the last look (`changed`), the goal the
look was made with, the page's kind and, for a transient page, how long it has
left. The router files it in a bounded **history** (`gPages.history`, rendered
by `gPages.trail()`) and runs the queue over it.

## The queue

Subscriptions are grouped into **bands** with fixed priorities, ordered within
a band, and topologically sorted by their declared `after` dependencies. They
run **one at a time**, and the first one to touch the screen ends the queue —
everything below would be acting on a frame that no longer exists.

```ts reference title="app.gap.Tsum/src/pages.ts"
https://github.com/game-automation-platform/game-automation-scripts/blob/main/app.gap.Tsum/src/pages.ts#L144-L166
```

Whether a subscription touched the screen is its **band's** answer, not a
value it returns: `guard`, `dismiss` and `navigate` act unless their `acts`
predicate declined. Which band a subscription joins is therefore a contract:

| Band | Promise |
|:--|:--|
| `observe` | Takes no captures, taps nothing. Always runs. |
| `record` | Measurements that need an untouched screen — captures included. |
| `guard` | Handles what is not a game screen at all: system dialogs, the root warning. |
| `dismiss` | Closes interruptions standing between the script and where it is going. |
| `navigate` | Moves toward the goal. **Silent when the look had no goal, and never on the destination page.** |
| `notify` | Logging and bookkeeping. Decides nothing, and runs even after the queue has stopped. |

Nothing checks this, and `PAGE_DISPATCH.md` will happily document a wrong
choice. A handler that captures belongs in `record`; one that taps belongs in
`guard`, `dismiss` or `navigate`.

Two rules carry most of the safety:

- **`navigate` is silent with no goal.** A goal is an argument to the look, not
  router state, which is what lets other callers detect every cycle without
  anything tapping the game away.
- **`navigate` never fires on the destination.** Arriving is `navigate()`'s job.

There is no blind fallback: navigation presses a page's `back` only where that
page's `PageRoutes` row says `back` is a way out. A page with no such row is
not tapped — `navigate()` logs `nav.noRoute` once and the stall guard takes
over. So **a new page that navigation has to leave needs its exit declared**,
or navigation will sit on it and say so.

## Subscriptions are data

A subscription is a list of `steps`, not a body: `tap` (an anchor of the entry
that matched — never a coordinate, because variants of a page put the same
button in different places), `tapAt`, `settle`, `sleep`, `waitOut`, `log` and
`call` for what is neither a tap nor a wait. Because the taps and the budgets
are data, `PAGE_DISPATCH.md` can print every one, and `tools/dispatchEval` can
pin them. Reading `pageHandlers.ts` top to bottom is reading the dispatch
order:

```ts reference title="app.gap.Tsum/src/pageHandlers.ts"
https://github.com/game-automation-platform/game-automation-scripts/blob/main/app.gap.Tsum/src/pageHandlers.ts#L1-L45
```

[Handle a page](../guides/handle-a-page) walks through adding one.

## Permanent and transient

Every `PageName` declares in `PageProfiles` (`data.ts`) how it leaves the
screen:

- **Permanent** — it waits for input, and the only way past it is a tap. The
  navigate band taps these.
- **Transient** — it dismisses itself after `durationMs`. Tapping it is worse
  than doing nothing: by the time the tap lands, the page is gone and the tap
  hits whatever replaced it. `nav.wait.transient` sits these out.

`PageProfiles` is a mapped type over `PageName`, so a name with no profile is a
build error rather than a page whose behaviour nobody decided. Durations are
quoted in frames rather than milliseconds, because that is how the game counts
these windows; the **Device frame rate** setting scales them.

## The five looks

```ts
gPages.detect()            // → PageName, after the subscriptions have run
gPages.observe()           // → the PageEvent, filed in the history, nothing run over it
gPages.react(event)        // run the queue over an event `observe` returned
gPages.peek()              // → detection with no broadcast and no history
gPages.matches(name)       // → is *this* page up? A cheaper, per-page check
gPages.navigate(PageName.FriendPage)   // look and act until we are there
```

`detect` is `observe` then `react`. `peek` is for "where am I?" from code that
must not set anything in motion. Writing the *caller* — a task that walks a
flow rather than reacting to one screen — is
[Driving screens](../guides/driving-screens).

## Modes are not pages

A fever is not a screen: it is the same board with the lights down and the
gauge turned into a timer. State like that is read from its own probe table
(`ts.isFeverTime()`, `fever.ts`) and never from the matched key — a `Page`
entry's `variant` is documentation and tooling by contract; the script only
ever learns the page *name*. Formal Beast's twin gauge and the Lorcana
transformation are the other two modes, and each has a watcher modelled on
`fever.ts`.
