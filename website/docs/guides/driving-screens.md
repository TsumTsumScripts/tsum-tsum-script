# Driving screens

[Handle a page](handle-a-page) is about reacting to one screen. This is about
being the thing doing the walking: a task that navigates to a screen, waits for
one, taps something that changes what is under it, and reads a list while
changing it. The level-cap sweep (`levelCap.ts`) is the fullest example in the
tree.

## What is shared, and what you write

| | Shared — use it | Yours to write, per flow |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Which screen is up** | `gPages` — `sweep` / `detect` / `peek` / `matches`; the `Page` table and `PageProfiles` | a `PageDef` per new screen, and a corpus frame for it |
| **Getting to a screen** | `gPages.navigate`, the `PageDef` anchors, `AnchorRoutes` | a `NavPlans` entry if the destination is a navigable one, and a `pageHandlers.ts` subscription for the tap that reaches it |
| **Leaving a screen** | the router: `navigate` plus the `dismiss` band | nothing, if the screen has an edge in the graph |
| **Anything inside a screen** — a grid, a list, a row, a badge | **nothing** | all of it |

The last row is the one to take seriously. There is no shared list or grid
abstraction, and deliberately so: the collection's grid, the mailbox's rows and
the friend list's heart column are each their own table, read by one flow. A
second list means a second table. **The router owns which screen you are on and
how to get between them; you own everything drawn inside one.**

## The rules

### 1. "What is on screen?" and "is *this* on screen?" are different questions

`sweep` / `detect` / `peek` score every entry against each probe's own
tolerance and take the best. `matches(name)` scores only that page's entries,
against a fixed tolerance, ignoring the entry's own. So for a page that is only
ever asked about by `matches()`, the thresholds written in its entry are dead
text. Put its probes on flat colour, where a pixel of drift cannot cost much.

### 2. Aliasing runs both ways

`targeted` stops an entry winning a sweep it has no business winning. It does
**not** stop some *other* entry answering with your page's screen. A device log
saying a flow "saw" a page it could not possibly have navigated to is usually
an alias, not a wrong turn. Usually leave it: ask instead whether the claiming
page's taps are ones the real screen tolerates. Retuning the claiming entry
needs a corpus frame of *its* page.

### 3. Navigation is a loop with a budget

`navigate()`'s cost is a plan in `NavPlans`: per pass, a number of captures,
then on a hit a hold spent *looking*, a settle and a confirming look; on a miss
the whole timeout. Three rules keep that from being paid needlessly:

- **Do not hop when you are already there, or one tap from it.** A look taken
  then and there beats a stale `this.page`.
- **A waypoint is not an arrival.** A screen you tap straight off again needs
  no settle, no rest and no second look; the outer loop confirms the real goal.
- **A budget is spent looking, never sleeping.** A wait that is protecting
  against something has to be watching for it, or it is only a delay.

And: **`peek`, not `detect`, for "where am I?"** anywhere outside the drive
loop — a guard, a diagnostic. `detect` broadcasts, and a handler may tap, so
the question changes the screen.

### 4. A screen that waits for a tap can swallow one

A toast with no button waits for a tap anywhere — but a tap landing while it is
still animating in is swallowed by the animation. `tap` followed by a passive
wait is a coin flip you lose occasionally. The pattern that works:

```
until the deadline:
  is the destination up?      -> done
  is the blocking screen up?  -> tap it
  rest
still here?                   -> gPages.navigate(destination)
```

On a screen you are *staying on*, the answer is a **read-back**: tap, ask the
screen what it now says, tap again if it did not change. A fingerprint is
chosen from the parts that identify a page, and those are painted first — so a
screen can be recognisable a good while before the control you mean to press
has been drawn.

### 5. An animation is measured in frames, so never wait a fixed number of milliseconds for one

The game animates on a frame counter, so the same animation takes half as long
on a device running twice as fast. A fixed `sleep` after a tap is a guess bound
to the device it was measured on — wasted on a faster one, expired mid-animation
on a slower one, where the next tap is swallowed.

**Watch the screen instead of the clock.** `ts.settleScreen(maxMs)` samples a
coarse grid twice and returns as soon as almost nothing moved. `maxMs` is a
ceiling, not a cost. Four caveats:

- The board never goes still; `settleScreen` over one can only time out. Use
  `ts.settleBoard`, which watches the play square alone, and keep its `minMs`
  floor — a cut-in can hold the board motionless before the clear.
- Small perpetual motion is not an animation: "still" allows a few moving
  points, so a pulsing badge does not hold the gate.
- **Still is not the same as ready.** A screen whose contents are still loading
  is motionless behind its fingerprint, and a placeholder can read as real
  content. Read for the content itself, in a poll with its own budget, and give
  "not there yet" an answer of its own.
- Put the settle in the shared wait (`awaitPage`, `drive`), not at each call
  site.

```

### 6. Re-read a list you are changing

If what you do to slot *i* can move what is in slot *i+1*, do not read the
viewport once and walk it. Re-read after every action and take **the first slot
that still qualifies**: if the game reorders, the next item slid into slot 0; if
it does not, slot 0 no longer qualifies and you take slot 1. One rule, correct
under both, and you never have to know which game you are in. "Viewport done"
versus "list done" is the same trick: when nothing qualifies, move on by one and
look again.

### 7. A list is not where you left it

Opening and closing a dialog over a list can scroll it — to keep the *selected*
item in view, which is wherever the player last was. **Read your position off a
control's absence, rewind to a known end unconditionally, and bound the rewind
by the real length of the list.** Burst the taps and look once (the capture is
the expensive half of a page turn); overshooting is free only when the control
is drawn just while it applies — check that first.

### 8. One hiccup should not end a flow

A dialog that opened a beat late is not a disagreement between two readings.
Give a flow a small **miss budget** with a re-grounding step between tries and a
loud stop when it is spent — and a separate **runaway guard** for the opposite
failure, because "repeat until you find X" is unbounded on the day X never
comes, and each turn may spend something the player owns.

### 9. Every wait that can time out must say what it saw

```ts
const seen = gPages.peek(1, 500);
logWarn(Log.Unlock.PageMissed, 'Waited for a screen that did not come',
  {want: page, saw: seen === null ? 'nothing' : seen.name, waitedMs: timeoutMs});
```

Put it in the *wait*, not at each call site. A timeout that does not say what
was on screen instead is a bug report nobody can act on.

### 10. Test the flow offline

Load the built bundle under the shim, make a `Tsum` with real methods and
stubbed leaves, and drive the task:

```js
const { ctx, host } = load.createRuntime();      // rebuilds if src/ is newer
const ts = Object.create(ctx.Tsum.prototype);    // real methods, stubbed leaves
ts.tap = ...; ts.sleep = ...; ts.readCappedCards = ...;
ts.taskAutoUnlockLevel();
```

Stub only the leaves — `tap`, `sleep`, whatever reads pixels — and let the loop,
the counters and the give-up conditions be the real ones. Model the game's
behaviour as a parameter (re-sorts or not; swallows *n* taps) and assert the
flow is right for every value. The bundle has its own realm, so patch `Date.now`
*inside* it with `vm.runInContext`, or a deadline test spins against the real
clock. [Test without a device](test-without-a-device).

### 11. Before believing a behaviour report, confirm what is on the device

The version string does not change between builds; the **build date does**, and
the settings page shows it. `build/index.js` is what the offline tools read;
`dist/index.js` is what ships. Only the second is deployed.
